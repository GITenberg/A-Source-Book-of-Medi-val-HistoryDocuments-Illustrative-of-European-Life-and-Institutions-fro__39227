<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>This book has been prepared in consequence of a conviction, derived
from some years of teaching experience, (1) that sources, of
proper kind and in carefully regulated amount, can profitably be
made use of by teachers and students of history in elementary college
classes, in academies and preparatory schools, and in the more advanced
years of the average high school, and (2) that for mediæval
history there exists no published collection which is clearly adapted
to practical conditions of work in such classes and schools.</p>

<p>It has seemed to me that a source book designed to meet the requirements
of teachers and classes in the better grade of secondary
schools, and perhaps in the freshman year of college work, ought to
comprise certain distinctive features, first, with respect to the character
of the selections presented, and, secondly, in regard to general
arrangement and accompanying explanatory matter. In the choice
of extracts I have sought to be guided by the following considerations:
(1) that in all cases the materials presented should be of real
value, either for the historical information contained in them or for
the more or less indirect light they throw upon mediæval life or conditions;
(2) that, for the sake of younger students, a relatively large proportion
of narrative (annals, chronicles, and biography) be introduced
and the purely documentary material be slightly subordinated; (3) that,
despite this principle, documents of vital importance, such as <i>Magna
Charta</i> and <i>Unam Sanctam</i>, which cannot be ignored in even the most
hasty or elementary study, be presented with some fulness; and (4) that,
in general, the rule should be to give longer passages from fewer sources,
rather than more fragmentary ones from a wider range.</p>

<p>With respect to the manner of presenting the selections, I have
sought: (1) to offer careful translations&mdash;some made afresh from the
printed originals, others adapted from good translations already available&mdash;but
with as much simplification and modernization of language
as close adherence to the sense will permit. Literal, or nearly literal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
translations are obviously desirable for maturer students, but, because
of the involved character of mediæval writings, are rarely readable,
and are as a rule positively repellent to the young mind; (2) to provide
each selection, or group of selections, with an introductory explanation,
containing the historical setting of the extract, with perhaps
some comment on its general significance, and also a brief sketch of
the writer, particularly when he is an authority of exceptional importance,
as Einhard, Joinville, or Froissart; and (3) to supply, in foot-notes,
somewhat detailed aid to the understanding of obscure allusions,
omitted passages, and especially place names and technical terms.</p>

<p>For permission to reprint various translations, occasionally verbatim
but usually in adapted form, I am under obligation to the following:
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin and Co., publishers of Miss Henry's translation
of Dante's <i>De Monarchia</i>; Messrs. Henry Holt and Co.,
publishers of Lee's <i>Source Book of English History</i>; Messrs. Ginn and
Co., publishers of Robinson's <i>Readings in European History</i>; Messrs.
Charles Scribner's Sons, publishers of Thatcher and McNeal's <i>Source
Book for Mediæval History</i>; Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, publishers
of Robinson and Rolfe's <i>Petrarch</i>; and Professor W. E. Lingelbach, of
the University of Pennsylvania, representing the University of Pennsylvania
<i>Translations and Reprints from the Original Sources of European
History</i>.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the book I have received invaluable assistance
from numerous persons, among whom the following, at least, should
be named: Professor Samuel B. Harding, of the University of Indiana,
who read the entire work in manuscript and has followed its progress
from the first with discerning criticism; Professor Charles H. Haskins,
of Harvard University, who has read most of the proof-sheets, and
whose scholarship and intimate acquaintance with the problems of
history teaching have contributed a larger proportion of whatever
merits the book possesses than I dare attempt to reckon up; and
Professors Charles Gross and Ephraim Emerton, likewise of Harvard,
whose instruction and counsel have helped me over many hard places.</p>

<p>The final word must be reserved for my wife, who, as careful amanuensis,
has shared the burden of a not altogether easy task.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>THE NATURE AND USE OF HISTORICAL SOURCES</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>If one proposes to write a history of the times of Abraham Lincoln,
how shall one begin, and how proceed? Obviously, the first thing
needed is information, and as much of it as can be had. But how shall
information, accurate and trustworthy, be obtained? Of course there
are plenty of books on Lincoln, and histories enough covering the
period of his career to fill shelf upon shelf. It would be quite possible
to spread some dozens of these before one's self and, drawing simply
from them, work out a history that would read well and perhaps
have a wide sale. And such a book might conceivably be worth while.
But if you were reading it, and were a bit disposed to query into the
accuracy of the statements made, you would probably find yourself
wondering before long just where the writer got his authority for this
or that assertion; and if, in foot-note or appendix, he should seem to
satisfy your curiosity by citing some other biography or history, you
would be quite justified in feeling that, after all, your inquiry remained
unanswered,&mdash;for whence did this second writer get <i>his</i> authority? If
<span class="sidebar">The question
of authority
in a book
of history</span>
you were thus persistent you would probably get hold of the volume
referred to and verify, as we say, the statements of fact
or opinion attributed to it. When you came upon them
you might find it there stated that the point in question
is clearly established from certain of Lincoln's own letters or
speeches, which are thereupon cited, and perhaps quoted in part.
At last you would be satisfied that the thing must very probably be
true, for there you would have the words of Lincoln himself upon it;
or, on the other hand, you might discover that your first writer had
merely adopted an opinion of somebody else which did not have behind
it the warrant of any first-hand authority. In either case you might
well wonder why, instead of using and referring only to books of other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
later authors like himself, he did not go directly to Lincoln's own works,
get his facts from them, and give authority for his statements at first
hand. And if you pushed the matter farther it would very soon occur
to you that there are some books on Lincoln and his period which are
not carefully written, and therefore not trustworthy, and that your
author may very well have used some of these, falling blindly into their
errors and at times wholly escaping the correct interpretation of things
which could be had, in incontrovertible form, from Lincoln's own pen,
or from the testimony of his contemporaries. In other words, you
would begin to distrust him because he had failed to go to the
"sources" for his materials, or at least for a verification of them.</p>

<p>How, then, shall one proceed in the writing of history in order to
make sure of the indispensable quality of accuracy? Clearly, the first
thing to be borne in mind is the necessity of getting information through
channels which are as direct and immediate as possible. Just as in
ascertaining the facts regarding an event of to-day it would be desirable
to get the testimony of an eye-witness rather than an account
after it had passed from one person to another, suffering more or less
distortion at every step, so, in seeking a trustworthy description of the
<span class="sidebar">The superiority
of direct
sources of
knowledge</span>
battle of Salamis or of the personal habits of Charlemagne,
the proper course would be to lay hold first of
all of whatever evidence concerning these things has
come down from Xerxes's or Charlemagne's day to our own, and to put
larger trust in this than in more recent accounts which have been played
upon by the imagination of their authors and perhaps rendered wholly
misleading by errors consciously or unconsciously injected into them.
The writer of history must completely divest himself of the notion that
a thing is true simply because he finds it in print. He may, and
should, read and consider well what others like himself have written
upon his subject, but he should be wary of accepting what he finds in
such books without himself going to the materials to which these
writers have resorted and ascertaining whether they have been used
with patience and discrimination. If his subject is Lincoln, he should,
for example, make sure above everything else, of reading exhaustively
the letters, speeches, and state papers which have been preserved,
in print or in manuscript, from Lincoln's pen. Similarly, he should
examine with care all letters and communications of every kind transmitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
to Lincoln. Then he should familiarize himself with the writings
of the leading men of Lincoln's day, whether in the form of letters,
diaries, newspaper and magazine articles, or books. The files, indeed,
of all the principal periodicals of the time should be gone through in
quest of information or suggestions not to be found in other places.
And, of course, the vast mass of public and official records would be
invaluable&mdash;the journals of the two houses of Congress, the dispatches,
orders, and accounts of the great executive departments, the arguments
before the courts, with the resulting decisions, and the all but numberless
other papers which throw light upon the practical conditions and
achievements of the governing powers, national, state, and local. However
much one may be able to acquire from the reading of later biographies
and histories, he ought not to set about the writing of a new
book of the sort unless he is willing to toil patiently through all these
first-hand, contemporary materials and get some warrant from them,
as being nearest the events themselves, for everything of importance
that he proposes to say. This rule is equally applicable and urgent
whatever the subject in hand&mdash;whether the age of Pericles, the Roman
Empire, the Norman conquest of England, the French Revolution, or
the administrations of George Washington&mdash;though, obviously, the
character and amount of the contemporary materials of which one can
avail himself varies enormously from people to people and from period
to period.</p>

<p>History is unlike many other subjects of study in that our knowledge
of it, at best, must come to us almost wholly through indirect
means. That is to say, all our information regarding the past, and most
of it regarding our own day, has to be obtained, in one form or another,
through other people, or the remains that they have left behind them.
No one of us can know much about even so recent an event as the
<span class="sidebar">Indirect
character of
all historical
knowledge</span>
Spanish-American War, except by reading newspapers,
magazines and books, talking with men who had part
in it, or listening to public addresses concerning it&mdash;all
indirect means. And, of course, when we go back of the memory of
men now living, say to the American Revolution, nobody can lay claim
to an iota of knowledge which he has not acquired through indirect
channels. In physics or chemistry, if a student desires, he can reproduce
in the laboratory practically any phenomenon which he finds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
described in his books; he need not accept the mere word of his text
or of his teacher, but can actually behold the thing with his own eyes.
Such experimentation, however, has no place in the study of history,
for by no sort of art can a Roman legion or a German comitatus or the
battle of Hastings be reproduced before mortal eye.</p>

<p>For our knowledge of history we are therefore obliged to rely absolutely
upon human testimony, in one form or another, the value of
such testimony depending principally upon the directness with which
it comes to us from the men and the times under consideration. If it
reaches us with reasonable directness, and represents a well authenticated
means of studying the period in question from the writings or other
<span class="sidebar">An "historical
source"
defined</span>
traces left by that period, it is properly to be included
in the great body of materials which we have come to
call historical sources. An historical source may be
defined as any product of human activity or existence that can be
used as direct evidence in the study of man's past life and institutions.
A moment's thought will suggest that there are "sources" of numerous
and widely differing kinds. Roughly speaking, at least, they fall into
two great groups: (1) those in writing and (2) those in some form other
than writing. The first group is by far the larger and more important.
Foremost in it stand annals, chronicles, and histories, written from time
to time all along the line of human history, on the cuneiform
tablets of the Assyrians or the parchment rolls of the mediæval monks,
in the polished Latin of a Livy or the sprightly French of a Froissart.
Works of pure literature also&mdash;epics, lyrics, dramas, essays&mdash;because
of the light that they often throw upon the times in which they were
written, possess a large value of the same general character. Of nearly
equal importance is the great class of materials which may be called
documentary&mdash;laws, charters, formulæ, accounts, treaties, and official
<span class="sidebar">Written
sources</span>
orders or instructions. These last are obviously of
largest value in the study of social customs, land
tenures, systems of government, the workings of courts, ecclesiastical
organizations, and political agencies&mdash;in other words, of <i>institutions</i>&mdash;just
as chronicles and histories are of greatest service in unraveling the
<i>narrative</i> side of human affairs.</p>

<p>Of sources which are not in the form of writing, the most important
are: (1) implements of warfare, agriculture, household economy, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the chase, large quantities of which have been brought to light in
various parts of the world, and which bear witness to the manner of
life prevailing among the peoples who produced and used them; (2) coins,
hoarded up in treasuries or buried in tombs or ruins of one sort or another,
<span class="sidebar">Sources
other than
in writing</span>
frequently preserving likenesses of important sovereigns, with
dates and other materials of use especially in fixing
chronology; (3) works of art, surviving intact or with
losses or changes inflicted by the ravages of weather
and human abuse&mdash;the tombs of the Egyptians, the sculpture of the
Greeks, the architecture of the Middle Ages, or the paintings of the
Renaissance; (4) other constructions of a more practical character,
particularly dwelling-houses, roads, bridges, aqueducts, walls, gates,
fortresses, and ships,&mdash;some well preserved and surviving as they were
first fashioned, others in ruins, and still others built over and more or
less obscured by modern improvement or adaptation.</p>

<p>These are some of the things to which the writer of history must go
for his facts and for his inspiration, and it is to these that the
student, whose business is to learn and not to write, ought occasionally
to resort to enliven and supplement what he finds in the books. As
there are many kinds of sources, so there are many ways in which such
materials may be utilized. If, for example, you are studying the life of
the Greeks and in that connection pay a visit to a museum of fine arts
and scrutinize Greek statuary, Greek vases, and Greek coins, you
are very clearly using sources. If your subject is the church life of
the later Middle Ages and you journey to Rheims or Amiens or Paris
to contemplate the splendid cathedrals in these cities, with their spires
<span class="sidebar">Various
ways of using
sources</span>
and arches and ornamentation, you are, in every
proper sense, using sources. You are doing the same
thing if you make an observation trip to the Egyptian
pyramids, or to the excavated Roman forum, or if you traverse the
line of old Watling Street&mdash;nay, if you but visit Faneuil Hall, or tramp
over the battlefield of Gettysburg. Many of these more purely "material"
sources can be made use of only after long and sometimes
arduous journeys, or through the valuable, but somewhat less
satisfactory, medium of pictures and descriptions. Happily, however,
the art of printing and the practice of accumulating enormous
libraries have made possible the indefinite duplication of <i>written</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
sources, and consequently the use of them at almost any time and in
almost any place. There is but one Sphinx, one Parthenon, one Sistine
Chapel; there are not many Roman roads, feudal castles, or Gothic
cathedrals; but scarcely a library in any civilized country is without
a considerable number of the monumental <i>documents</i> of human history&mdash;the
funeral oration of Pericles, the laws of Tiberius Gracchus, Magna
Charta, the theses of Luther, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution of the
United States&mdash;not to mention the all but limitless masses of histories,
biographies, poems, letters, essays, memoirs, legal codes, and official
records of every variety which are available for any one who seriously
desires to make use of them.</p>

<p>But why should the younger student trouble himself, or be troubled,
with any of these things? Might he not get all the history he can be
expected to know from books written by scholars who have given their
lives to exploring, organizing, and sifting just such sources? There can
be no question that schools and colleges to-day have the use of better
text-books in history than have ever before been available, and that
truer notions of the subject in its various relations can be had from even
the most narrow devotion to these texts than could be had from the
study of their predecessors a generation ago. If the object of studying
history were solely to acquire facts, it would, generally speaking, be a
waste of time for high school or younger college students to wander far
from text-books. But, assuming that history is studied not alone for
the mastery of facts but also for the broadening of culture, and for certain
kinds of mental training, the properly regulated use of sources by the
student himself is to be justified on at least three grounds: (1) Sources
<span class="sidebar">The value
of sources
to the student</span>
help to an understanding of the point of view of the men,
and the spirit of the age under consideration. The
ability to dissociate one's self from his own surroundings
and habits of thinking and to put himself in the company of Cæsar, of
Frederick Barbarossa, or of Innocent III., as the occasion may require,
is the hardest, but perhaps the most valuable, thing that the student
of history can hope to get. (2) Sources add appreciably to the vividness
and reality of history. However well-written the modern description
of Charlemagne, for example, the student ought to find a somewhat
different flavor in the account by the great Emperor's own friend
and secretary, Einhard; and, similarly, Matthew Paris's picture of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the raving and fuming of Frederick II. at his excommunication by
Pope Gregory ought to bring the reader into a somewhat more intimate
appreciation of the character of the proud German-Sicilian emperor.
(3) The use of sources, in connection with the reading of secondary
works, may be expected to train the student, to some extent at least,
in methods of testing the accuracy of modern writers, especially when
the subject in hand is one that lends itself to a variety of interpretations.
In the sources the makers of history, or those who stood close
to them, are allowed to speak for themselves, or for their times, and the
study of such materials not only helps plant in the student's mind the
conception of fairness and impartiality in judging historical characters,
but also cultivates the habit of tracing things back to their origins and
verifying what others have asserted about them. So far as practicable
the student of history, from the age of fourteen and onwards, should be
encouraged to develop the critical or judicial temperament along with
the purely acquisitive.</p>

<p>In preparing a source book, such as the present one, the purpose is to
further the study of the most profitable sources by removing some of
the greater difficulties, particularly those of accessibility and language.
Clearly impracticable as anything like historical "research" undoubtedly
is for younger students, it is none the less believed that there are
abundant first-hand materials in the range of history which such students
will not only find profitable but actually enjoy, and that any
<span class="sidebar">Simplicity
of many
mediæval
sources</span>
acquaintance with these things that may be acquired
in earlier studies will be of inestimable advantage subsequently.
It is furthermore believed, contrary to the
assertions that one sometimes hears, that the history of the Middle
Ages lends itself to this sort of treatment with scarcely, if any, less
facility than that of other periods. Certainly Gregory's Clovis, Asser's
Alfred, Einhard's Charlemagne, and Joinville's St. Louis are living personalities,
no less vividly portrayed than the heroes of a boy's storybook.
Tacitus's description of the early Germans, Ammianus's account
of the crossing of the Danube by the Visigoths and his pictures of the
Huns, Bede's narrative of the Saxon invasion of Britain, the affectionate
letter Stephen of Blois to his wife and children, the portrayal
of the sweet-spirited St. Francis by the Three Companions, and Froissart's
free and easy sketch of the battle of Crécy are all interesting, easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
comprehended, and even adapted to whet the appetite for a larger acquaintance
with these various people and events. Even solid documents,
like the Salic law, the Benedictine Rule, the Peace of Constance,
and the Golden Bull, if not in themselves exactly attractive,
may be made to have a certain interest for the younger student when
he realizes that to know mediæval history at all he is under the imperative
necessity of getting much of the framework of things either from
such materials or from text-books which essentially reproduce them.
It is hoped that at least a reasonable proportion of the selections
herewith presented may serve in some measure to overcome for the
student the remote and intangible character which the Middle Ages
have much too commonly, though perhaps not unnaturally, been felt
to possess.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
THE EARLY GERMANS</h3>

<h4>1. A Sketch by Cæsar</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>One of the most important steps in the expansion of the Roman
Republic was the conquest of Gaul by Julius Cæsar just before the middle
of the first century <span class="s07">B.C.</span> Through this conquest Rome entered deliberately
upon the policy of extending her dominion northward from
the Mediterranean and the Alps into the regions of western and central
Europe known to us to-day as France and Germany. By their wars
in this direction the Romans were brought into contact with peoples
concerning whose manner of life they had hitherto known very little.
There were two great groups of these peoples&mdash;the Gauls and the
Germans&mdash;each divided and subdivided into numerous tribes and clans.
In general it may be said that the Gauls occupied what we now call
France and the Germans what we know as Belgium, Holland, Denmark,
Germany, and Austria. The Rhine marked a pretty clear boundary
between them.</p>

<p>During the years 58-50 <span class="s07">B.C.</span>, Julius Cæsar, who had risen to the
proconsulship through a long series of offices and honors at Rome,
served the state as leader of five distinct military expeditions in this
country of the northern barbarians. The primary object of these
campaigns was to establish order among the turbulent tribes of Gauls
and to prepare the way for the extension of Roman rule over them.
This great task was performed very successfully, but in accomplishing
it Cæsar found it necessary to go somewhat farther than had at first
been intended. In the years 55 and 54 <span class="s07">B.C.</span>, he made two expeditions
to Britain to punish the natives for giving aid to their Celtic kinsfolk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
in Gaul, and in 55 and 53 he crossed the Rhine to compel the Germans
to remain on their own side of the river and to cease troubling the Gauls
by raids and invasions, as they had recently been doing. When (about
51 <span class="s07">B.C.</span>) he came to write his <i>Commentaries on the Gallic War</i>, it is
very natural that he should have taken care to give a brief sketch of
the leading peoples whom he had been fighting, that is, the Gauls, the
Britons, and the Germans. There are two places in the <i>Commentaries</i>
where the Germans are described at some length. At the beginning
of Book IV. there is an account of the particular tribe known as the
Suevi, and in the middle of Book VI. there is a longer sketch of the
Germans in general. This latter is the passage translated below. Of
course we are not to suppose that Cæsar's knowledge of the Germans
was in any sense thorough. At no time did he get far into their
country, and the people whose manners and customs he had an
opportunity to observe were only those who were pressing down upon,
and occasionally across, the Rhine boundary&mdash;a mere fringe of the
great race stretching back to the Baltic and, at that time, far eastward
into modern Russia. We may be sure that many of the more remote
German tribes lived after a fashion quite different from that which
Cæsar and his legions had an opportunity to observe on the Rhine-Danube
frontier. Still, Cæsar's account, vague and brief as it is, has
an importance that can hardly be exaggerated. These early Germans
had no written literature and but for the descriptions of them left by
a few Roman writers, such as Cæsar, we should know almost nothing
about them. If we bear in mind that the account in the <i>Commentaries</i>
was based upon very keen, though limited, observation, we can get out
of it a good deal of interesting information concerning the early ancestors
of the great Teutonic peoples of the world to-day.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> The customs of the Germans differ widely from those of
the Gauls;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for neither have they Druids to preside over religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
services,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> nor do they give much attention to sacrifices. They
count in the number of their gods those only whom they can
see, and by whose favors they are clearly aided;
that is to say, the Sun, Vulcan,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the Moon.
<span class="sidebar">Their
religion</span>
Of other deities they have never even heard. Their whole life
is spent in hunting and in war. From childhood they are trained
in labor and hardship....</p>

<p><b>22.</b> They are not devoted to agriculture, and the greater
portion of their food consists of milk, cheese, and flesh. No one
<span class="sidebar">Their system
of land tenure</span>
owns a particular piece of land, with fixed limits,
but each year the magistrates and the chiefs
assign to the clans and the bands of kinsmen who have assembled
together as much land as they think proper, and in whatever
place they desire, and the next year compel them to move to
some other place. They give many reasons for this custom&mdash;that
the people may not lose their zeal for war through habits
established by prolonged attention to the cultivation of the
soil; that they may not be eager to acquire large possessions,
and that the stronger may not drive the weaker from their
property; that they may not build too carefully, in order to
avoid cold and heat; that the love of money may not spring up,
from which arise quarrels and dissensions; and, finally, that the
common people may live in contentment, since each person
sees that his wealth is kept equal to that of the most powerful.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> It is a matter of the greatest glory to the tribes to lay
waste, as widely as possible, the lands bordering their territory,
thus making them uninhabitable.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They regard it as the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
proof of their valor that their neighbors are forced to withdraw
from those lands and hardly any one dares set foot there; at the
same time they think that they will thus be more secure, since
the fear of a sudden invasion is removed. When a tribe is either
repelling an invasion or attacking an outside people, magistrates
<span class="sidebar">Leaders and
officers in war
and peace</span>
are chosen to lead in the war, and these are given
the power of life and death. In times of peace
there is no general magistrate, but the chiefs of
the districts and cantons render justice among their own people
and settle disputes.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Robbery, if committed beyond the borders
of the tribe, is not regarded as disgraceful, and they say that it is
practised for the sake of training the youth and preventing
idleness. When any one of the chiefs has declared in an assembly
that he is going to be the leader of an expedition, and that
those who wish to follow him should give in their names, they
who approve of the undertaking, and of the man, stand up and
promise their assistance, and are applauded by the people.
Such of these as do not then follow him are looked upon as
deserters and traitors, and from that day no one has any faith
in them.</p>

<p>To mistreat a guest they consider to be a crime. They protect
<span class="sidebar">German
hospitality</span>

from injury those who have come among them for
any purpose whatever, and regard them as sacred.

<h4>2. A Description by Tacitus</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<div class="intro">
<p>Tacitus (54-119),<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who is sometimes credited with being the
greatest of Roman historians, published his treatise on the <i>Origin,
Location, Manners, and Inhabitants of Germany</i> in the year 98. This
was about a century and a half after Cæsar wrote his <i>Commentaries</i>.
During this long interval we have almost no information as to how the
Germans were living or what they were doing. There is much uncertainty
as to the means by which Tacitus got his knowledge of them. We
may be reasonably sure that he did not travel extensively through the
country north of the Rhine; there is, in fact, not a shred of evidence
that he ever visited it at all. He tells us that he made use of Cæsar's
account, but this was very meager and could not have been of much
service. We are left to surmise that he drew most of his information
from books then existing but since lost, such as the writings of
Posidonius of Rhodes (136-51 <span class="s07">B.C.</span>) and Pliny the Elder (23-79).
These sources were doubtless supplemented by the stories of officials
and traders who had been among the Germans and were afterwards
interviewed by the historian. Tacitus's essay, therefore, while written
with a desire to tell the truth, was apparently not based on first-hand
information. The author nowhere says that he had <i>seen</i> this or that
feature of German life. We may suppose that what he really did was
to gather up all the stories and reports regarding the German barbarians
which were already known to Roman traders, travelers, and soldiers,
sift the true from the false as well as he could, and write out in first class
Latin the little book which we know as the <i>Germania</i>. The theory that
the work was intended as a satire, or sermon in morals, for the benefit
of a corrupt Roman people has been quite generally abandoned, and
this for the very good reason that there is nothing in either the treatise's
contents or style to warrant such a belief. Tacitus wrote the book
because of his general interest in historical and geographical subjects,
and also, perhaps, because it afforded him an excellent opportunity to
display a literary skill in which he took no small degree of pride. That
it was published separately instead of in one of his larger histories may
have been due to public interest in the subject during Trajan's wars in
the Rhine country in the years 98 and 99. The first twenty-seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
chapters, from which the selections below are taken, treat of the Germans
in general&mdash;their origin, religion, family life, occupations, military tactics,
amusements, land system, government, and social classes; the last
nineteen deal with individual tribes and are not so accurate or so valuable.
It will be found interesting to compare what Tacitus says with
what Cæsar says when both touch upon the same topic. In doing so it
should be borne in mind that there was a difference in time of a century
and a half between the two writers, and also that while Tacitus probably
did not write from experience among the Germans, as Cæsar did, he
nevertheless had given the subject a larger amount of deliberate study.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> For my own part, I agree with those who think that the
tribes of Germany are free from all trace of intermarriage with
<span class="sidebar">Physical characteristics</span>
foreign nations, and that they appear as a distinct,
unmixed race, like none but themselves.
Hence it is that the same physical features are to be observed
throughout so vast a population. All have fierce blue eyes, reddish
hair, and huge bodies fit only for sudden exertion. They are
not very able to endure labor that is exhausting. Heat and thirst
they cannot withstand at all, though to cold and hunger their
climate and soil have hardened them.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Iron is not plentiful among them, as may be inferred from
the nature of their weapons.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Only a few make use of swords or
long lances. Ordinarily they carry a spear (which they call a
<i>framea</i>), with a short and narrow head, but so sharp and easy to
handle that the same weapon serves, according to circumstances,
for close or distant conflict. As for the horse-soldier, he is satisfied
with a shield and a spear. The foot-soldiers also scatter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
showers of missiles, each man having several and hurling them
to an immense distance, and being naked or lightly clad with a
little cloak. They make no display in their equipment. Their
shields alone are marked with fancy colors. Only a few have
corselets,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and just one or two here and there a metal or leather
<span class="sidebar">Their weapons
and mode of
fighting</span>
helmet.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Their horses are neither beautiful nor
swift; nor are they taught various wheeling
movements after the Roman fashion, but are
driven straight forward so as to make one turn to the right in
such a compact body that none may be left behind another. On
the whole, one would say that the Germans' chief strength is in
their infantry. It fights along with the cavalry, and admirably
adapted to the movements of the latter is the swiftness of certain
foot-soldiers, who are picked from the entire youth of their
country and placed in front of the battle line.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The number of
these is fixed, being a hundred from each <i>pagus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and from this
they take their name among their countrymen, so that what was
at the outset a mere number has now become a title of honor.
Their line of battle is drawn up in the shape of a wedge. To
yield ground, provided they return to the attack, is regarded as
prudence rather than cowardice. The bodies of their slain
they carry off, even when the battle has been indecisive. To
abandon one's shield is the basest of crimes. A man thus disgraced
is not allowed to be present at the religious ceremonies, or
to enter the council. Many, indeed, after making a cowardly
escape from battle put an end to their infamy by hanging themselves.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p><b>7.</b> They choose their kings<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> by reason of their birth, but their
generals on the ground of merit. The kings do not enjoy unlimited
or despotic power, and even the generals command more
by example than by authority. If they are energetic, if they take
a prominent part, if they fight in the front, they lead because
they are admired. But to rebuke, to imprison, even to flog, is
allowed to the priests alone, and this not as a punishment, or at
the general's bidding, but by the command of the god whom
they believe to inspire the warrior. They also carry with them
<span class="sidebar">The Germans
in battle</span>
into battle certain figures and images taken
from their sacred groves.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The thing that most
strengthens their courage is the fact that their troops are not
made up of bodies of men chosen by mere chance, but are arranged
by families and kindreds. Close by them, too, are those
dearest to them, so that in the midst of the fight they can hear
the shrieks of women and the cries of children. These loved ones
are to every man the most valued witnesses of his valor, and at
the same time his most generous applauders. The soldier brings
his wounds to mother or wife, who shrinks not from counting
them, or even demanding to see them, and who provides food
for the warriors and gives them encouragement.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> About matters of small importance the chiefs alone take
counsel, but the larger questions are considered by the entire
tribe. Yet even when the final decision rests with the people
the affair is always thoroughly discussed by the chiefs. Except
in the case of a sudden emergency, the people hold their assemblies
on certain fixed days, either at the new or the full moon;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
for these they consider the most suitable times for the transaction
<span class="sidebar">Their popular
assemblies</span>
of business. Instead of counting by days, as we do,
they count by nights, and in this way designate
both their ordinary and their legal engagements. They regard
the night as bringing on the day. Their freedom has one disadvantage,
in that they do not all come together at the same time,
or as they are commanded, but two or three days are wasted in
the delay of assembling. When the people present think proper,
they sit down armed. Silence is proclaimed by the priests who,
on these occasions, are charged with the duty of keeping order.
The king or the leader speaks first, and then others in order, as
age, or rank, or reputation in war, or eloquence, give them right.
The speakers are heard more because of their ability to persuade
than because of their power to command. If the speeches are
displeasing to the people, they reject them with murmurs; if they
are pleasing, they applaud by clashing their weapons together,
which is the kind of applause most highly esteemed.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><b>13.</b> They transact no public or private business without being
armed, but it is not allowable for any one to bear arms until he
has satisfied the tribe that he is fit to do so. Then, in the presence
of the assembly, one of the chiefs, or the young man's father, or
some kinsman, equips him with a shield and a spear. These arms
are what the toga is with the Romans, the first honor with which
a youth is invested. Up to this time he is regarded as merely a
member of a household, but afterwards as a member of the state.
Very noble birth, or important service rendered by the father,
secures for a youth the rank of chief, and such lads attach themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
to men of mature strength and of fully tested valor. It is no
<span class="sidebar">The chiefs and
their companions</span>
shame to be numbered among a chief's companions.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The companions
have different ranks in the band, according
to the will of the chief; and there is great
rivalry among the companions for first place in
the chief's favor, as there is among the chiefs for the possession
of the largest and bravest throng of followers. It is an honor, as
well as a source of strength, to be thus always surrounded by a
large body of picked youths, who uphold the rank of the chief in
peace and defend him in war. The fame of such a chief and his
band is not confined to their own tribe, but is spread among
foreign peoples; they are sought out and honored with gifts in
order to secure their alliance, for the reputation of such a band
may decide a whole war.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> In battle it is considered shameful for the chief to allow
any of his followers to excel him in valor, and for the followers
not to equal their chief in deeds of bravery. To survive the chief
and return from the field is a disgrace and a reproach for life.
To defend and protect him, and to add to his renown by courageous
fighting is the height of loyalty. The chief fights for
victory; the companions must fight for the chief. If their native
state sinks into the sloth of peace and quiet, many noble youths
<span class="sidebar">The German
love of war</span>
voluntarily seek those tribes which are waging
some war, both because inaction is disliked by
their race and because it is in war that they win renown most
readily; besides, a chief can maintain a band only by war, for
the men expect to receive their war-horse and their arms from
their leader. Feasts and entertainments, though not elegant, are
plentifully provided and constitute their only pay. The means of
such liberality are best obtained from the booty of war. Nor
are they as easily persuaded to plow the earth and to wait for the
year's produce as to challenge an enemy and earn the glory of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
wounds. Indeed, they actually think it tame and stupid to
acquire by the sweat of toil what they may win by their blood.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><b>15.</b> When not engaged in war they pass much of their time in
the chase, and still more in idleness, giving themselves up to
sleep and feasting. The bravest and most warlike do no work;
they give over the management of the household, of the home,
and of the land to the women, the old men, and the weaker
<span class="sidebar">Life in times
of peace</span>
members of the family, while they themselves
remain in the most sluggish inactivity. It is
strange that the same men should be so fond of idleness and yet
so averse to peace.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It is the custom of the tribes to make their
chiefs presents of cattle and grain, and thus to give them the
means of support.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The chiefs are especially pleased with gifts
from neighboring tribes, which are sent not only by individuals,
but also by the state, such as choice steeds, heavy armor, trappings,
and neck-chains. The Romans have now taught them to
accept money also.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> It is a well-known fact that the peoples of Germany have
no cities, and that they do not even allow buildings to be erected
close together.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> They live scattered about, wherever a spring, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
a meadow, or a wood has attracted them. Their villages are not
arranged in the Roman fashion, with the buildings connected
and joined together, but every person surrounds his dwelling
with an open space, either as a precaution against the disasters
<span class="sidebar">Lack of cities
and towns</span>
of fire, or because they do not know how to build.
They make no use of stone or brick, but employ
wood for all purposes. Their buildings are mere rude masses,
without ornament or attractiveness, although occasionally they
are stained in part with a kind of clay which is so clear and
bright that it resembles painting, or a colored design....</p>

<p><b>23.</b> A liquor for drinking is made out of barley, or other grain,
and fermented so as to be somewhat like wine. The dwellers
<span class="sidebar">Their food
and drink</span>

along the river-bank<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> also buy wine from traders.
Their food is of a simple variety, consisting of
wild fruit, fresh game, and curdled milk. They satisfy their
hunger without making much preparation of cooked dishes, and
without the use of any delicacies at all. In quenching their
thirst they are not so moderate. If they are supplied with as
much as they desire to drink, they will be overcome by their
own vices as easily as by the arms of an enemy.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> At all their gatherings there is one and the same kind of
amusement. This is the dancing of naked youths amid swords and
<span class="sidebar">German
amusements</span>
lances that all the time endanger their lives. Experience
gives them skill, and skill in turn gives
grace. They scorn to receive profit or pay, for, however reckless
their pastime, its reward is only the pleasure of the spectators.
Strangely enough, they make games of chance a serious employment,
even when sober, and so venturesome are they about winning
or losing that, when every other resource has failed, on the
final throw of the dice they will stake even their own freedom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
He who loses goes into voluntary slavery and, though the younger
and stronger of the players, allows himself to be bound and sold.
Such is their stubborn persistency in a bad practice, though they
themselves call it honor. Slaves thus acquired the owners trade
off as speedily as possible to rid themselves of the scandal of
such a victory.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
THE VISIGOTHIC INVASION</h3>
<h4>3. The Visigoths Cross the Danube (376)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The earliest invasion of the Roman Empire which resulted in the permanent
settlement of a large and united body of Germans on Roman
soil was that of the Visigoths in the year 376. This invasion was
very far, however, from marking the first important contact of the German
and Roman peoples. As early as the end of the second century
<span class="s07">B.C.</span> the incursions of the Cimbri and Teutones (113-101) into southern
Gaul and northern Italy had given Rome a suggestion of the danger
which threatened from the northern barbarians. Half a century later,
the Gallic campaigns of Cæsar brought the two peoples into conflict for
the first time in the region of the later Rhine boundary, and had the
very important effect of preventing the impending Germanization of
Gaul and substituting the extension of Roman power and civilization in
that quarter. Roman imperial plans on the north then developed along
ambitious lines until the year 9 <span class="s07">A.D.</span>, when the legions of the Emperor
Augustus, led by Varus, were defeated, and in large part annihilated, in
the great battle of the Teutoberg Forest and the balance was turned
forever against the Romanization of the Germanic countries. Thereafter
for a long time a state of equilibrium was preserved along the
Rhine-Danube frontier, though after the Marcomannic wars in the latter
half of the second century the scale began to incline more and more
against the Romans, who were gradually forced into the attitude of
defense against a growing disposition of the restless Germans to push
the boundary farther south.</p>

<p>During the more than three and a half centuries intervening between
the battle of the Teutoberg and the crossing of the Danube by the Visigoths,
the intermingling of the two peoples steadily increased. On the
one hand were numerous Roman travelers and traders who visited the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Germans living along the frontier and learned what sort of people they
were. The soldiers of the legions stationed on the Rhine and Danube
also added materially to Roman knowledge in this direction. But much
more important was the influx of Germans into the Empire to serve as
soldiers or to settle on lands allotted to them by the government. Owing
to a general decline of population, and especially to the lack of a sturdy
middle class, Rome found it necessary to fill up her army with foreigners
and to reward them with lands lying mainly near the frontiers, but often
in the very heart of the Empire. The over-population of Germany furnished
a large class of excellent soldiers who were ready enough to accept
the pay of the Roman emperor for service in the legions, even if rendered,
as it often was, against their kinsmen who were menacing the weakened
frontier. From this source the Empire had long been receiving a large
infusion of German blood before any considerable tribe came within its
bounds to settle in a body. Indeed, if there had occurred no sudden and
startling overflows of population from the Germanic countries, such as
the Visigothic invasion, it is quite possible that the Roman Empire
might yet have fallen completely into the hands of the Germans by
the quiet and gradual processes just indicated. As it was, the pressure
from advancing Asiatic peoples on the east was too great to be
withstood, and there resulted, between the fourth and sixth centuries, a
series of notable invasions which left almost the entire Western Empire
parceled out among new Germanic kingdoms established by force on
the ruins of the once invincible Roman power. The breaking of the
frontier by the West Goths (to whom the Emperor Aurelian, in 270,
had abandoned the rich province of Dacia), during the reign of Gratian
in the West and of Valens in the East, was the first conspicuous step
in this great transforming movement.</p>

<p>The ferocious people to whose incursions Ammianus refers as the cause
of the Visigothic invasion were the Huns [see <a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>], who had but
lately made their first appearance in Europe. Already by 376 the Ostrogothic
kingdom of Hermaneric, to the north of the Black Sea, had fallen
before their onslaught, and the wave of conquest was spreading rapidly
westward toward Dacia and the neighboring lands inhabited by the
Visigoths. The latter people were even less able to make effectual resistance
than their eastern brethren had been. Part of them had become
Christians and were recognizing Fridigern as their leader, while the remaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
pagan element acknowledged the sway of Athanaric. On the
arrival of the Huns, Athanaric led his portion of the people into the
Carpathian Mountains and began to prepare for resistance, while
the Christians, led by Fridigern and Alaf (or Alavivus), gathered on
the Danube and begged permission to take refuge across the river in
Roman territory. Athanaric and his division of the Visigoths, having
become Christians, entered the Empire a few years later and settled
in Moesia.</p>

<p>Ammianus Marcellinus, author of the account of the Visigothic invasion
given below, was a native of Antioch, a soldier of Greek ancestry
and apparently of noble birth, and a member of the Eastern emperor's
bodyguard. Beyond these facts, gleaned from his <i>Roman History</i>, we
have almost no knowledge of the man. The date of his birth is unknown,
likewise that of his death, though from his writings it appears that he
lived well toward the close of the fourth century. His <i>History</i> began
with the accession of Nerva, 96 <span class="s07">A.D.</span>, approximately where the accounts
by Tacitus and Suetonius end, and continued to the death of his master
Valens in the battle of Adrianople in 378. It was divided into thirty-one
books; but of these thirteen have been lost, and some of those which
survive are imperfect. Although the narrative is broken into rather
provokingly here and there by digressions on earthquakes and eclipses
and speculations on such utterly foreign topics as the theory of the destruction
of lions by mosquitoes, it nevertheless constitutes an invaluable
source of information on the men and events of the era which it
covers. Its value is greatest, naturally, on the period of the Visigothic
invasion, for in dealing with these years the author could describe events
about which he had direct and personal knowledge. Ammianus is to be
thought of as the last of the old Roman school of historians.</p>

<p>In the meantime a report spread extensively through the other
nations of the Goths [i.e., the Visigoths], that a race of men,
hitherto unknown, had suddenly descended like a whirlwind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
from the lofty mountains, as if they had risen from some secret
recess of the earth, and were ravaging and destroying everything
that came in their way. Then the greater part of the population
(which, because of their lack of necessities, had deserted
Athanaric), resolved to flee and to seek a home remote from all
knowledge of the barbarians; and after a long deliberation as to
where to fix their abode, they resolved that a retreat into Thrace
<span class="sidebar">Visigoths ask
permission to
settle within
the Empire</span>
was the most suitable, for these two reasons: first
of all, because it is a district most abundant in
grass; and in the second place, because, by the
great breadth of the Danube, it is wholly separated from the barbarians
[i.e., the Goths], who were already exposed to the thunderbolts
of foreign warfare. And the whole population of the tribe
adopted this resolution unanimously. Accordingly, under the
command of their leader Alavivus, they occupied the banks of
the Danube; and having sent ambassadors to Valens,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> they humbly
entreated that they might be received by him as his subjects,
promising to live peaceably and to furnish a body of auxiliary
troops, if any necessity for such a force should arise.</p>

<p>While these events were passing in foreign countries, a terrible
rumor arose that the tribes of the north were planning new and
<span class="sidebar">Rumors of
Gothic movements
reach
Rome</span>
unprecedented attacks upon us,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and that over
the whole region which extends from the country
of the Marcomanni and Quadi to Pontus,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> a
barbarian host composed of various distant nations which had
suddenly been driven by force from their own country, was now,
with all their families, wandering about in different directions
on the banks of the river Danube.</p>

<p>At first this intelligence was treated lightly by our people, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
they were not in the habit of hearing of any wars in those
remote regions until after they had been terminated either by victory
or by treaty. But presently the belief in these occurrences
grew stronger, being confirmed, moreover, by the arrival of
the foreign ambassadors who, with prayers and earnest entreaties,
<span class="sidebar">Their coming
represented as
a blessing to
the Empire</span>
begged that the people thus driven from
their homes and now encamped on the other side of
the river might be kindly received by us. The affair
seemed a cause of joy rather than of fear, according to the skilful
flatterers who were always extolling and exaggerating the good
fortune of the Emperor; congratulating him that an embassy had
come from the farthest corners of the earth unexpectedly, offering
him a large body of recruits, and that, by combining the
strength of his own nation with these foreign forces, he would
have an army absolutely invincible; observing farther that, by
the payment for military reinforcements which came in every
year from the provinces, a vast treasure of gold might be accumulated
in his coffers.</p>

<p>Full of this hope, he sent several officers to bring this ferocious
people and their wagons into our territory. And such great
<span class="sidebar">The crossing of
the Danube</span>
pains were taken to gratify this nation, which was
destined to overthrow the empire of Rome, that
not one was left behind, not even of those who were stricken with
mortal disease. Moreover, having obtained permission of the
Emperor to cross the Danube and to cultivate some districts in
Thrace, they crossed the stream day and night, without ceasing,
embarking in troops on board ships and rafts, and canoes made
of the hollow trunks of trees. In this enterprise, since the Danube
is the most difficult of all rivers to navigate, and was at that time
swollen with continual rains, a great many were drowned, who,
because they were too numerous for the vessels, tried to swim
across, and in spite of all their exertions were swept away by
the stream.</p>

<p>In this way, through the turbulent zeal of violent people, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
ruin of the Roman Empire was brought on. This, at all events,
is neither obscure nor uncertain, that the unhappy officers who
<span class="sidebar">Number of the
invaders</span>

were intrusted with the charge of conducting
the multitude of the barbarians across the river,
though they repeatedly endeavored to calculate their numbers,
at last abandoned the attempt as useless; and the man who
would wish to ascertain the number might as well attempt to
count the waves in the African sea, or the grains of sand tossed
about by the zephyr.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<h4>4. The Battle of Adrianople (378)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Before crossing the Danube the Visigoths had been required by the
Romans to give up their arms, and also a number of their children to be
held as hostages. In return it was understood that the Romans would
equip them afresh with arms sufficient for their defense and with food
supplies to maintain them until they should become settled in their
new homes. So far as our information goes, it appears that the Goths
fulfilled their part of the contract, or at least were willing to do so. But
the Roman officers in Thrace saw an opportunity to enrich themselves
by selling food to the famished barbarians at extortionate prices, and a
few months of such practices sufficed to arouse all the rage and resentment
of which the untamed Teuton was capable. In the summer of 378
the Goths broke out in open revolt and began to avenge themselves by
laying waste the Roman lands along the lower Danube frontier. The
Eastern emperor, Valens, hastened to the scene of insurrection, but only
to lose the great battle of Adrianople, August 9, 378, and to meet his own
death. "The battle of Adrianople," says Professor Emerton, "was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
of the decisive battles of the world. It taught the Germans that they
could beat the legions in open fight and that henceforth it was for them
to name the price of peace. It broke once for all the Rhine-Danube
frontier." Many times thereafter German armies, and whole tribes,
were to play the rôle of allies of Rome; but neither German nor Roman
could be blinded to the fact that the decadent empire of the south lay at
the mercy of the stalwart sons of the northern wilderness.</p>

(Leipzig, 1875), Vol. II., pp. 261-269.</p>

<p>He [Valens] was at the head of a numerous force, neither unwarlike
nor contemptible, and had united with them many
<span class="sidebar">The Goths approach
the Roman
army</span>
veteran bands, among whom were several officers
of high rank&mdash;especially Trajan, who a little
while before had been commander of the forces.
And as, by means of spies and observation, it was ascertained that
the enemy was intending to blockade with strong divisions the
different roads by which the necessary supplies must come, he
sent a sufficient force to prevent this, dispatching a body of the
archers of the infantry and a squadron of cavalry with all speed
to occupy the narrow passes in the neighborhood. Three days
afterwards, when the barbarians, who were advancing slowly
because they feared an attack in the unfavorable ground which
they were traversing, arrived within fifteen miles from the station
of Nice<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (which was the aim of their march), the Emperor, with
wanton impetuosity, resolved on attacking them instantly, because
those who had been sent forward to reconnoitre (what
led to such a mistake is unknown) affirmed that the entire body
of the Goths did not exceed ten thousand men....<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>When the day broke which the annals mark as the fifth of the
Ides of August [Aug. 9] the Roman standards were advanced
with haste. The baggage had been placed close to the walls of
Adrianople, under a sufficient guard of soldiers of the legions.
The treasures and the chief insignia of the Emperor's rank were
within the walls, with the prefect and the principal members of
<span class="sidebar">The battle
begins</span>
the council.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Then, having traversed the broken
ground which divided the two armies, as the
burning day was progressing towards noon, at last, after marching
eight miles, our men came in sight of the wagons of the enemy,
which had been reported by the scouts to be all arranged in a circle.
According to their custom, the barbarian host raised a fierce and
hideous yell, while the Roman generals marshalled their line of
battle. The right wing of the cavalry was placed in front; the
chief portion of the infantry was kept in reserve....<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>And while arms and missiles of all kinds were meeting in
fierce conflict, and Bellona,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> blowing her mournful trumpet, was
raging more fiercely than usual, to inflict disaster on the Romans,
our men began to retreat; but presently, aroused by the reproaches
of their officers, they made a fresh stand, and the battle
increased like a conflagration, terrifying our soldiers, numbers
of whom were pierced by strokes of the javelins hurled at them,
and by arrows.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>Then the two lines of battle dashed against each other, like the
beaks of ships and, thrusting with all their might, were tossed to
and fro like the waves of the sea. Our left wing had advanced
actually up to the wagons, with the intent to push on still farther
if properly supported; but they were deserted by the rest of
the cavalry, and so pressed upon by the superior numbers of
<span class="sidebar">The fury of
the conflict</span>
the enemy that they were overwhelmed and beaten down like
the ruin of a vast rampart. Presently our infantry
also was left unsupported, while the various
companies became so huddled together that a soldier
could hardly draw his sword, or withdraw his hand after he had
once stretched it out. And by this time such clouds of dust arose
that it was scarcely possible to see the sky, which resounded
with horrible cries; and in consequence the darts, which were
bearing death on every side, reached their mark and fell with
deadly effect, because no one could see them beforehand so as
to guard against them. The barbarians, rushing on with their
enormous host, beat down our horses and men and left no spot
to which our ranks could fall back to operate. They were so
closely packed that it was impossible to escape by forcing a way
through them, and our men at last began to despise death and
again taking to their swords, slew all they encountered, while
with mutual blows of battle-axes, helmets and breastplates were
dashed in pieces.</p>

<p>Then you might see the barbarian, towering in his fierceness,
hissing or shouting, fall with his legs pierced through, or his
right hand cut off, sword and all, or his side transfixed, and
still, in the last gasp of life, casting around him defiant glances.
The plain was covered with corpses, showing the mutual ruin of
the combatants; while the groans of the dying, or of men fearfully
wounded, were intense and caused much dismay on all sides. Amid
all this great tumult and confusion our infantry were exhausted
by toil and danger, until at last they had neither strength left to
fight nor spirits to plan anything. Their spears were broken by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
the frequent collisions, so that they were forced to content themselves
with their drawn swords, which they thrust into the
<span class="sidebar">The Romans
put to flight</span>
dense battalions of the enemy, disregarding their
own safety, and seeing that every possibility
of escape was cut off from them.... The sun, now high
in the heavens (having traversed the sign of Leo and reached
the abode of the heavenly Virgo<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>) scorched the Romans, who
were emaciated by hunger, worn out with toil, and scarcely able
to support even the weight of their armor. At last our columns
were entirely beaten back by the overpowering weight of the
barbarians, and so they took to disorderly flight, which is the
only resource in extremity, each man trying to save himself as
best he could....</p>

<p>Scarcely one third of the whole army escaped. Nor, except
the battle of Cannæ, is so destructive a slaughter recorded in our
annals;<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> though, even in the times of their prosperity, the Romans
have more than once been called upon to deplore the
uncertainty of war, and have for a time succumbed to evil
Fortune.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
THE HUNS</h3>

<h4>5. Descriptions by a Graeco-Roman Poet and a Roman Historian</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The Huns, a people of Turanian stock, were closely related to the ancestors
of the Magyars, or the modern Hungarians. Their original
home was in central Asia, beyond the great wall of China, and they were
in every sense a people of the plains rather than of the forest or of the
sea. From the region of modern Siberia they swept westward in successive
waves, beginning about the middle of the fourth century, traversed
the "gateway of the nations" between the Caspian Sea and the
Ural Mountains, and fell with fury upon the German tribes (mainly the
Goths) settled in eastern and southern Europe. The descriptions of
them given by Claudius Claudianus and Ammianus Marcellinus set
forth their characteristics as understood by the Romans a half-century
or more before the invasion of the Empire by Attila. There is no
reason to suppose that either of these authors had ever seen a Hun, or
had his information at first hand. When both wrote the Huns were yet
far outside the Empire's bounds. Tales of soldiers and travelers, which
doubtless grew as they were told, must have supplied both the poet
and the historian with all that they knew regarding the strange Turanian
invaders. This being the case, we are not to accept all that they
say as the literal truth. Nevertheless the general impressions which one
gets from their pictures cannot be far wrong.</p>

<p>Claudius Claudianus, commonly regarded as the last of the Latin
classic poets, was a native of Alexandria who settled at Rome about
395. For ten years after that date he occupied a position at the court
of the Emperor Honorius somewhat akin to that of poet-laureate.
Much of his writing was of a very poor quality, but his descriptions
were sometimes striking, as in the stanza given below. On Ammianus
Marcellinus see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>.

spreading from the marshes of Azof to the Icy Sea,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> surpasses
all other barbarians in wildness of life. In the first days of infancy,
deep incisions are made in the cheeks of their boys, in order
that when the time comes for whiskers to grow there, the sprouting
hairs may be kept back by the furrowed scars; and hence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
they grow to maturity and to old age beardless. They all,
however, have strong, well-knit limbs and fine necks. Yet they
<span class="sidebar">Physical appearance
of the
Huns</span>
are of portentous ugliness and so crook-backed
that you would take them for some sort of two-footed
beasts, or for the roughly-chipped stakes
which are used for the railings of a bridge. And though they do
just bear the likeness of men (of a very ugly type), they are so
little advanced in civilization that they make no use of fire, nor
of any kind of relish, in the preparation of their food, but feed
upon the roots which they find in the fields, and the half-raw
flesh of any sort of animal. I say half-raw, because they give it
a kind of cooking by placing it between their own thighs and the
backs of their horses. They never seek the shelter of houses,
which they look upon as little better than tombs, and will enter
only upon the direst necessity; nor would one be able to find
among them even a cottage of wattled rushes; but, wandering at
large over mountain and through forest, they are trained to endure
from infancy all the extremes of cold, of hunger, and of
thirst.</p>

<p>They are clad in linen raiment, or in the skins of field-mice
sewed together, and the same suit serves them for use in-doors
<span class="sidebar">Their dress</span>
and out. However dingy the color of it may
become, the tunic which has once been hung around their necks
is never laid aside nor changed until through long decay the rags
of it will no longer hold together. Their heads are covered with
bent caps, their hairy legs with the skins of goats; their shoes,
never having been fashioned on a last, are so clumsy that they
cannot walk comfortably. On this account they are not well
adapted to encounters on foot; but on the other hand they
are almost welded to their horses, which are hardy, though
of ugly shape, and on which they sometimes ride woman's
fashion. On horseback every man of that nation lives night and
day; on horseback he buys and sells; on horseback he takes his
meat and drink, and when night comes on he leans forward upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the narrow neck of his horse and there falls into a deep sleep, or
wanders into the varied fantasies of dreams.</p>

<p>When a discussion arises upon any matter of importance they
come on horseback to the place of meeting. No kingly sternness
overawes their deliberations, but being, on the whole, well-contented
with the disorderly guidance of their chiefs, they do
not scruple to interrupt the debates with anything that comes
into their heads. When attacked, they will sometimes engage
in regular battle. Then, going into the fight in order of columns,
<span class="sidebar">Their mode
of fighting</span>
they fill the air with varied and discordant cries.
More often, however, they fight in no regular
order of battle, but being extremely swift and sudden in their
movements, they disperse, and then rapidly come together
again in loose array, spread havoc over vast plains and, flying
over the rampart, pillage the camp of their enemy almost before
he has become aware of their approach. It must be granted
that they are the nimblest of warriors. The missile weapons
which they use at a distance are pointed with sharpened bones
admirably fastened to the shaft. When in close combat they
fight without regard to their own safety, and while the enemy
is intent upon parrying the thrusts of their swords they throw a
net over him and so entangle his limbs that he loses all power of
walking or riding.</p>

<p>Not one among them cultivates the ground, or ever touches a
plow-handle. All wander abroad without fixed abodes, without
<span class="sidebar">Their nomadic
character</span>
home, or law, or settled customs, like perpetual
fugitives, with their wagons for their only habitations.
If you ask them, not one can tell you what is his place
of origin. They are ruthless truce-breakers, fickle, always ready
to be swayed by the first breath of a new desire, abandoning
themselves without restraint to the most ungovernable rage.</p>

<p>Finally, like animals devoid of reason, they are utterly ignorant
of what is proper and what is not. They are tricksters with
words and full of dark sayings. They are never moved by either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
religious or superstitious awe. They burn with unquenchable
thirst for gold, and they are so changeable and so easily moved
to wrath that many times in the day they will quarrel with their
comrades on no provocation, and be reconciled, having received
no satisfaction.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
THE EARLY FRANKS</h3>

<h4>6. The Deeds of Clovis as Related by Gregory of Tours</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The most important historical writer among the early Franks was
a bishop whose full name was Georgius Florentius Gregorius, but who
has commonly been known ever since his day as Gregory of Tours.
The date of his birth is uncertain, but it was probably either 539 or
540. He was not a Frank, but a man of mixed Roman and Gallic
descent, his parentage being such as to rank him among the nobility
of his native district, Auvergne. At the age of thirty-four he was elected
bishop of Tours, and this important office he held until his death in
594. During this long period of service he won distinction as an able
church official, as an alert man of affairs, and as a prolific writer on
ecclesiastical subjects. Among his writings, some of which have been
lost, were a book on the Christian martyrs, biographies of several holy
men of the Church, a commentary on the Psalms, and a treatise on
the officers of the Church and their duties.</p>

<p>But by far his largest and most important work was his <i>Ecclesiastical
History of the Franks</i>, in ten books, written well toward the end of
his life. It is indeed to be regarded as one of the most interesting pieces
of literature produced in any country during the Middle Ages. For
his starting point Gregory went back to the Garden of Eden, and what
he gives us in his first book is only an amusing but practically worthless
account of the history of the world from Adam to St. Martin of
Tours, who died probably in 397. In the second book, however, he
comes more within the range of reasonable tradition, if not of actual
information, and brings the story down to the death of Clovis in 511.
In the succeeding eight books he reaches the year 591, though it is
thought by some that the last four were put together after the author's
death by some of his associates. However that may be, we may rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
assured that the history grows in accuracy as it approaches the period
in which it was written. Naturally it is at its best in the later books,
where events are described that happened within the writer's lifetime,
and with many of which he had a close connection. Gregory was
a man of unusual activity and of wide acquaintance among the influential
people of his day. He served as a counselor of several Frankish
kings and was a prominent figure at their courts. The shrine of
St. Martin of Tours<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> was visited by pilgrims from all parts of the Christian
world and by conversation with them Gregory had an excellent
opportunity to keep informed as to what was going on among the Franks,
and among more distant peoples as well. He was thus fortunately situated
for one who proposed to write the history of his times. As a
bishop of the orthodox Church he had small regard for Arians and other
heretics, and so was in some ways less broad-minded than we could
wish; and of course he shared the superstition and ignorance of his age,
as will appear in some of the selections below. Still, without his extensive
history we should know far less than we now do concerning the
Frankish people before the seventh century. He mixes legend with fact
in a most confusing manner, but with no intention whatever to deceive.
The men of the earlier Middle Ages knew no other way of writing
history and their readers were not critical as we are to-day. The
passages quoted below from Gregory's history give some interesting
information concerning the Frankish conquerors of Gaul, and at the
same time show something of the spirit of Gregory himself and of the
people of his times.</p>

<p>Particularly interesting is the account of the conversion of Clovis
and of the Franks to Christianity. When the Visigoths, Ostrogoths,
Vandals, Lombards, and Burgundians crossed the Roman frontiers
and settled within the bounds of the old Empire they were all Christians
in name, however much their conduct might be at variance with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
their profession. The Franks, on the other hand, established themselves
in northern Gaul, as did the Saxons in Britain, while they were
yet pagans, worshipping Woden and Thor and the other strange deities
of the Germans. It was about the middle of the reign of King Clovis,
or, more definitely, in the year 496, that the change came. In his
<i>Ecclesiastical History</i> Gregory tells us how up to this time all the influence
of the Christian queen, Clotilde, had been exerted in vain to
bring her husband to the point of renouncing his old gods. In his wars
and conquests the king had been very successful and apparently he
was pretty well satisfied with the favors these old gods had showered
upon him and was unwilling to turn his back upon such generous
patrons. But there came a time, in 496, in the course of the war with
the Alemanni, when the tide of fortune seemed to be turning against
the Frankish king. In the great battle of Strassburg the Franks were
on the point of being beaten by their foe, and Clovis in desperation
made a vow, as the story goes, that if Clotilde's God would grant him
a victory he would immediately become a Christian. Whatever may
have been the reason, the victory was won and the king, with characteristic
German fidelity to his word, proceeded to fulfill his pledge.
Amid great ceremony he was baptized, and with him three thousand
of his soldiers the same day. The great majority of Franks lost little
time in following the royal example.</p>

<p>Two important facts should be emphasized in connection with this
famous incident. The first is the peculiar character of the so-called
"conversion" of Clovis and his Franks. We to-day look upon religious
conversion as an inner experience of the individual, apt to be
brought about by personal contact between a Christian and the person
who is converted. It was in no such sense as this, however, that the
Franks&mdash;or any of the early Germans, for that matter&mdash;were made
Christian. They looked upon Christianity as a mere portion of Roman
civilization to be adopted or let alone as seemed best; but if it were
adopted, it must be by the whole tribe or nation, not by individuals
here and there. In general, the German peoples took up Christianity,
not because they became convinced that their old religions were false,
but simply because they were led to believe that the Christian faith
was in some ways better than their own and so might profitably be
taken advantage of by them. Clovis believed he had won the battle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of Strassburg with the aid of the Christian God when Woden and
Thor were about to fail him; therefore he reasoned that it would be a
good thing in the future to make sure that the God of Clotilde should
always be on his side, and obviously the way to do this was to become
himself a Christian. He did not wholly abandon the old gods, but
merely considered that he had found a new one of superior power.
Hence he enjoined on all his people that they become Christians; and
for the most part they did so, though of course we are not to suppose
that there was any very noticeable change in their actual conduct and
mode of life, at least for several generations.</p>

<p>The second important point to observe is that, whereas all of the other
Germanic peoples on the continent had become Christians of the
Arian type, the Franks accepted Christianity in its orthodox form such
as was adhered to by the papacy. This was sheer accident. The
Franks took the orthodox rather than the heretical religion simply
because it was the kind that was carried to them by the missionaries,
not at all because they were able, or had the desire, to weigh the two
creeds and choose the one they liked the better. But though they
became orthodox Christians by accident, the fact that they became
such is of the utmost importance in mediæval history, for by being
what the papacy regarded as true Christians rather than heretics they
began from the start to be looked to by the popes for support. Their
kings in time became the greatest secular champions of papal interests,
though relations were sometimes far from harmonious. This virtual
alliance of the popes and the Frankish kings is a subject which will
repay careful study.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> After all these things Childeric<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> died and his son Clovis ruled
in his stead. In the fifth year of the new reign Syagrius, son of
Ægidius, was governing as king of the Romans in the town of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Soissons, where his father had held sway before him.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Clovis
now advanced against him with his kinsman Ragnachar, who
also held a kingdom, and gave him an opportunity to select a
field of battle. Syagrius did not hesitate, for he was not at all
afraid to risk an encounter. In the conflict which followed,
however, the Roman soon saw that his army was doomed to
destruction; so, turning and fleeing from the field, he made all
<span class="sidebar">The battle of
Soissons (486)</span>
haste to take refuge with King Alaric at Toulouse.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Clovis then sent word to Alaric that he
must hand over the defeated king at once if he did not wish to
bring on war against himself. Fearing the anger of the Franks,
therefore, as the Goths continually do, Alaric bound Syagrius
with chains and delivered him to the messengers of King Clovis.
As soon as the latter had the prisoner in his possession he put
him under safe guard and, after seizing his kingdom, had him
secretly slain.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>At this time the army of Clovis plundered many churches, for
the king was still sunk in the errors of idolatry. Upon one occasion
the soldiers carried away from a church, along with other
ornaments of the sacred place, a remarkably large and beautiful
vase. The bishop of that church sent messengers to the king to
<span class="sidebar">The story of
the broken
vase</span>
ask that, even if none of the other holy vessels
might be restored, this precious vase at least
might be sent back. To the messengers Clovis
could only reply: "Come with us to Soissons, for there all the
booty is to be divided. If when we cast lots the vase shall fall
to me, I will return it as the bishop desires."</p>

<p>When they had reached Soissons and all the booty had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
brought together in the midst of the army the king called attention
to the vase and said, "I ask you, most valiant warriors, to
allow me to have the vase in addition to my rightful share."
Then even those of his men who were most self-willed answered:
"O glorious king, all things before us are thine, and we ourselves
are subject to thy control. Do, therefore, what pleases thee best,
for no one is able to resist thee." But when they had thus
spoken, one of the warriors, an impetuous, jealous, and vain man,
raised his battle-ax aloft and broke the vase in pieces, crying as
he did so, "Thou shalt receive no part of this booty unless it fall
to you by a fair lot." And at such a rash act they were all
astounded.</p>

<p>The king pretended not to be angry and seemed to take no
notice of the incident, and when it happened that the broken
vase fell to him by lot he gave the fragments to the bishop's
messengers; nevertheless he cherished a secret indignation in
his heart. A year later he summoned all his soldiers to come
fully armed to the Campus Martius, so that he might make an
<span class="sidebar">Clovis's
revenge</span>
inspection of his troops.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> After he had reviewed
the whole army he finally came across the very
man who had broken the vase at Soissons. "No one," cried out
the king to him, "carries his arms so awkwardly as thou; for
neither thy spear nor thy sword nor thy ax is ready for use," and
he struck the ax out of the soldier's hands so that it fell to the
ground. Then when the man bent forward to pick it up the
king raised his own ax and struck him on the head, saying,
"Thus thou didst to the vase at Soissons." Having slain him,
he dismissed the others, filled with great fear....<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p><b>30.</b> The queen did not cease urging the king to acknowledge the
true God and forsake idols, but all her efforts failed until at length
a war broke out with the Alemanni.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Then of necessity he was
compelled to confess what hitherto he had wilfully denied. It
happened that the two armies were in battle and there was great
slaughter.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The army of Clovis seemed about to be cut in pieces.
Then the king raised his hands fervently toward the heavens
and, breaking into tears, cried: "Jesus Christ, who Clotilde declares
to be the son of the living God, who it is said givest help to
the oppressed and victory to those who put their trust in thee,
I invoke thy marvellous help. If thou wilt give me victory over
my enemies and I prove that power which thy followers say they
have proved concerning thee, I will believe in thee and will be
baptized in thy name; for I have called upon my own gods and
it is clear that they have neglected to give me aid. Therefore I
am convinced that they have no power, for they do not help those
<span class="sidebar">Clovis decides
to become a
Christian (496)</span>
who serve them. I now call upon thee, and I
wish to believe in thee, especially that I may
escape from my enemies." When he had offered
this prayer the Alemanni turned their backs and began to flee.
And when they learned that their king had been slain, they submitted
at once to Clovis, saying, "Let no more of our people
perish, for we now belong to you." When he had stopped the
battle and praised his soldiers for their good work, Clovis returned
in peace to his kingdom and told the queen how he had won the
victory by calling on the name of Christ. These events took
place in the fifteenth year of his reign.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p><b>31.</b> Then the queen sent secretly to the blessed Remigius, bishop
of Rheims, and asked him to bring to the king the gospel of
salvation. The bishop came to the court where, little by little,
he led Clovis to believe in the true God, maker of heaven and
earth, and to forsake the idols which could help neither him nor
any one else. "Willingly will I hear thee, O holy father," declared
the king at last, "but the people who are under my authority
are not ready to give up their gods. I will go and consult them
about the religion concerning which you speak." When he had
come among them, and before he had spoken a word, all the people,
through the influence of the divine power, cried out with
one voice: "O righteous king, we cast off our mortal gods and
we are ready to serve the God who Remigius tells us is immortal."</p>

<p>When this was reported to the bishop he was beside himself
with joy, and he at once ordered the baptismal font to be prepared.
The streets were shaded with embroidered hangings;
the churches were adorned with white tapestries, exhaling sweet
odors; perfumed tapers gleamed; and all the temple of the
<span class="sidebar">The baptism
of Clovis and
his warriors</span>
baptistry was filled with a heavenly odor, so
that the people might well have believed that
God in His graciousness showered upon them the
perfumes of Paradise. Then Clovis, having confessed that the
God of the Trinity was all-powerful, was baptized in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and was
anointed with the holy oil with the sign of the cross. More than
three thousand of his soldiers were baptized with him....</p>

<p><b>35.</b> Now when Alaric, king of the Goths, saw that Clovis was
conquering many nations, he sent messengers to him, saying, "If
it please my brother, let us, with the favor of God, enter into an
alliance." Clovis at once declared his willingness to do as Alaric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
suggested and the two kings met on an island in the Loire, near
the town of Amboise in the vicinity of Tours.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> There they talked,
ate, and drank together, and after making mutual promises of
friendship they departed in peace.</p>

<p><b>37.</b> But Clovis said to his soldiers: "It is with regret that I see
the Arian heretics in possession of any part of Gaul. Let us,
with the help of God, march against them and, after having conquered
them, bring their country under our own control." This
proposal was received with favor by all the warriors and the
army started on the campaign, going towards Poitiers, where
<span class="sidebar">Clovis resolves
to take the
Visigoths'
lands in Gaul</span>
Alaric was then staying. As a portion of the
troops passed through the territory about Tours,
Clovis, out of respect for the holy St. Martin,
forbade his soldiers to take anything from the country except
grass for the horses. One soldier, having come across some hay
which belonged to a poor man said, "Has, then, the king given us
permission to take only grass? O well! hay is grass. To take it
would not be to violate the command." And by force he took
the hay away from the poor man. When, however, the matter
was brought to the king's attention he struck the offender with
his sword and killed him, saying, "How, indeed, may we hope
for victory if we give offense to St. Martin?" This was enough
thereafter to prevent the army from plundering in that country.</p>

<p>When Clovis arrived with his forces at the banks of the Vienne
he was at a loss to know where to cross, because the heavy rains
<span class="sidebar">Miraculous incidents
of the
campaign</span>
had swollen the stream. During the night he
prayed that the Lord would reveal to him a
passage. The following morning, under the
guidance of God, a doe of wondrous size entered the river in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
plain sight of the army and crossed by a ford, thus pointing out
the way for the soldiers to get over. When they were in the
neighborhood of Poitiers the king saw at some distance from his
tent a ball of fire, which proceeded from the steeple of the church
of St. Hilary<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and seemed to him to advance in his direction, as
if to show that by the aid of the light of the holy St. Hilary he
would triumph the more easily over the heretics against whom
the pious priest had himself often fought for the faith. Clovis
then forbade his army to molest any one or to pillage any property
in that part of the country.</p>

<p>Clovis at length engaged in battle with Alaric, king of the
Goths, in the plain of Vouillé at the tenth mile-stone from
Poitiers.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The Goths fought with javelins, but the Franks
charged upon them with lances. Then the Goths took to flight,
as is their custom,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and the victory, with the aid of God, fell to
Clovis. He had put the Goths to flight and killed their king,
<span class="sidebar">The Visigoths
defeated by
Clovis (507)</span>
Alaric, when all at once two soldiers bore down
upon him and struck him with lances on both
sides at once; but, owing to the strength of his
armor and the swiftness of his horse, he escaped death. After
the battle Amalaric, son of Alaric, took refuge in Spain and ruled
wisely over the kingdom of his father.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Alaric had reigned
twenty-two years. Clovis, after spending the winter at Bordeaux
and carrying from Toulouse all the treasure of the king,
advanced on Angoulême. There the Lord showed him such
favor that at his very approach the walls of the city fell down of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
their own accord.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> After driving out the Goths he brought the
place under his own authority. Thus, crowned with victory,
he returned to Tours and bestowed a great number of presents
upon the holy church of the blessed Martin.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><b>40.</b> Now while Clovis was living at Paris he sent secretly to the
son of Sigibert,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> saying: "Behold now your father is old and
lame. If he should die his kingdom would come to you and my
friendship with it." So the son of Sigibert, impelled by his
ambition, planned to slay his father. And when Sigibert set
out from Cologne and crossed the Rhine to go through the
Buchonian forest,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> his son had him slain by assassins while he
was sleeping in his tent, in order that he might gain the kingdom
for himself. But by the judgment of God he fell into the pit
which he had digged for his father. He sent messengers to Clovis
to announce the death of his father and to say: "My father is
dead and I have his treasures, and likewise the kingdom. Now
send trusted men to me, that I may give them for you whatever
you would like out of his treasury." Clovis replied: "I thank
you for your kindness and will ask you merely to show my
messengers all your treasures, after which you may keep them
yourself." And when the messengers of Clovis came, the son of
Sigibert showed them the treasures which his father had collected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
And while they were looking at various things, he said: "My
father used to keep his gold coins in this little chest." And
<span class="sidebar">Other means
by which Clovis
extended
his power</span>
they said, "Put your hand down to the bottom,
that you may show us everything." But when he
stooped to do this, one of the messengers struck
him on the head with his battle-ax, and thus he met the fate
which he had visited upon his father.</p>

<p>Now when Clovis heard that both Sigibert and his son were
dead, he came to that place and called the people together and
said to them: "Hear what has happened. While I was sailing
on the Scheldt River, Cloderic, son of Sigibert, my relative,
attacked his father, pretending that I had wished him to slay
him. And so when his father fled through the Buchonian forest,
the assassins of Cloderic set upon him and slew him. But while
Cloderic was opening his father's treasure chest, some man
unknown to me struck him down. I am in no way guilty of these
things, for I could not shed the blood of my relatives, which is
very wicked. But since these things have happened, if it seems
best to you, I advise you to unite with me and come under my
protection." And those who heard him applauded his speech,
and, raising him on a shield, acknowledged him as their king.
Thus Clovis gained the kingdom of Sigibert and his treasures,
and won over his subjects to his own rule. For God daily confounded
his enemies and increased his kingdom, because he
walked uprightly before Him and did that which was pleasing in
His sight.</p>

<p><b>42.</b> Then Clovis made war on his relative Ragnachar.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> And
when the latter saw that his army was defeated, he attempted
to flee; but his own men seized him and his brother Richar and
brought them bound before Clovis. Then Clovis said: "Why
<span class="sidebar">The removal
of remaining
rivals</span>
have you disgraced our family by allowing yourself
to be taken prisoner? It would have been
better for you had you been slain." And, raising his battle-ax,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
he slew him. Then, turning to Richar, he said, "If you had
aided your brother he would not have been taken;" and he slew
him with the ax also. Thus by their death Clovis took their
kingdom and treasures. And many other kings and relatives
of his, who he feared might take his kingdom from him, were
slain, and his dominion was extended over all Gaul.</p>

<p><b>43.</b> And after these things he died at Paris and was buried in
the basilica of the holy saints which he and his queen, Clotilde,
had built. He passed away in the fifth year
<span class="sidebar">The death
of Clovis (511)</span>
after the battle of Vouillé, and all the days of
his reign were thirty years.</p>

<h4>7. The Law of the Salian Franks</h4>
<div class="intro">
<p>When the Visigoths, Lombards, and other Germanic peoples settled
within the bounds of the Roman Empire they had no such thing as
written law. They had laws, and a goodly number of them, but these
laws were handed down from generation to generation orally, having
never been enacted by a legislative body or decreed by a monarch in
the way that laws are generally made among the civilized peoples of
to-day. In other words, early Germanic law consisted simply of an
accumulation of the immemorial custom of the tribe. When, for
example, a certain penalty had been paid on several occasions by
persons who had committed a particular crime, men came naturally
to regard that penalty as the one regularly to be paid by <i>any one</i> proved
guilty of the same offense; so that what was at first only habit gradually
became hardened into law&mdash;unwritten indeed, but none the less binding.
The law thus made up, moreover, was personal rather than territorial
like that of the Romans and like ours to-day. That is, the same
laws did not apply to all the people throughout any particular country
or region. If a man were born a Visigoth he would be subject to Visigothic
law throughout life, no matter where he might go to live. So
the Burgundian would always have the right to be judged by Burgundian
law, and the Lombard by the Lombard law. Obviously, in
regions where several peoples dwelt side by side, as in large portions
of Gaul, Spain, and northern Italy, there was no small amount of confusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
and the courts had to be conducted in a good many different
ways.</p>

<p>After the Germans had been for some time in contact with the Romans
they began to be considerably influenced by the customs and
ways of doing things which they found among the more civilized people.
They tried to master the Latin language, though, on the whole,
they succeeded only so well as to create the new "Romance" tongues
which we know as French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian. They
adopted the Roman religion, i.e., Christianity. And, among the most
important things of all, they took up the Roman idea of having their
law written out rather than in the uncertain shape of mere tradition.
In this work of putting the old customary law in written form the way
was led by the Salian branch of the Franks. Just when the Salic code
was drawn up is not known, but the work was certainly done at some
time during the reign of Clovis, probably about the year 496. The
portions of this code which are given below will serve to show the
general character of all the early Germanic systems of law&mdash;Visigothic,
Lombard, Burgundian, and Frisian, as well as Frankish; for among
them all there was much uniformity in principles, though considerable
variation in matters of detail. Like the rest, the Salic law was fragmentary.
The codes were not intended to embrace the entire law of
the tribe, but simply to bring together in convenient form those portions
which were most difficult to remember and which were most useful
for ready reference. In the Salic code, for instance, we find a large
amount of criminal law and of the law of procedure, but only a few
touches of the law of property, or indeed of civil law of any sort. There
is practically nothing in the way of public or administrative law. Many
things are not mentioned which we should expect to find treated and,
on the other hand, some things are there which we should not look for
ordinarily in a code of law. The greater portion is taken up with
an enumeration of penalties for various crimes and wrongful acts.
These are often detailed so minutely as to be rather amusing from our
modern point of view. Yet every one of the sixty-five chapters of
the code has its significance and from the whole law can be gleaned
an immense amount of information concerning the manner of life which
prevailed in early Frankish Gaul. For the Merovingian period in
general the Salic law is our most valuable documentary source of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
knowledge, just as for the same epoch the <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> of
Gregory of Tours is our most important narrative source.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
THE ANGLES AND SAXONS IN BRITAIN</h3>

<h4>8. The Saxon Invasion (cir. 449)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The Venerable Bede, the author of the passage given below, was
born about 673 in Northumberland and spent most of his life in the
Benedictine abbey of Jarrow on the Tyne, where he died in 735. He
was a man of broad learning and untiring industry, famous in all parts
of Christendom by reason of the numerous scholarly books that he
wrote. The chief of these was his <i>Ecclesiastical History of the English
People</i>, covering the period from the first invasion of Britain by Cæsar
(<span class="s07">B.C.</span> 55) to the year 731. In this work Bede dealt with many matters
lying properly outside the sphere of church history, so that it
is exceedingly valuable for the light which it throws on both the military
and political affairs of the early Anglo-Saxons in Britain. As an
historian Bede was fair-minded and as accurate as his means of information
permitted.</p>

<p>The Angle and Saxon seafarers from the region we now know as
Denmark and Hanover had infested the shores of Britain for two centuries
or more before the coming of Hengist and Horsa which Bede
here describes. The withdrawal of the Roman garrisons about the
year 410 left the Britons at the mercy of the wilder Picts and Scots of
the north and west, and as a last resort King Vortigern decided to call
in the Saxons to aid in his campaign of defense. Such, at least, is the
story related by Gildas, a Romanized British chronicler who wrote about
the year 560, and this was the view adopted by Bede. Recent writers,
as Mr. James H. Ramsay in his <i>Foundations of England</i>, are inclined
to cast serious doubts upon the story because it seems hardly probable
that any king would have taken so foolish a step as that attributed
to Vortigern.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> At any rate, whether by invitation or for pure love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
of seafaring adventure, certain it is that the Saxons and Angles made
their appearance at the little island of Thanet, on the coast of Kent,
and found the country so much to their liking that they chose to remain
rather than return to the over-populated shores of the Baltic.
There are many reasons for believing that people of Germanic stock
had been settled more or less permanently in Britain long before the
traditional invasion of Hengist and Horsa. Yet we are justified in
thinking of this interesting expedition as, for all practical purposes, the
beginning of the long and stubborn struggle of Germans to possess the
fruitful British isle. While Visigoths and Ostrogoths, Vandals and
Lombards were breaking across the Rhine-Danube frontier and finding
new homes in the territories of the Roman Empire, the Angles,
Saxons, and Jutes from the farther north were led by their seafaring
instincts to make their great movement, not by land, but by water,
and into a country which the Romans had a good while before been
obliged to abandon. There they were free to develop their own peculiar
Germanic life and institutions, for the most part without undergoing
the changes which settlement among the Romans produced in the case
of the tribes whose migrations were towards the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>They consulted what was to be done,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and where they should
seek assistance to prevent or repel the cruel and frequent incursions
<span class="sidebar">The Britons
decide to call
in the Saxons</span>
of the northern nations. And they all
agreed with their king, Vortigern, to call over to
their aid, from the parts beyond the sea, the
Saxon nation; which, as the outcome still more plainly showed,
appears to have been done by the inspiration of our Lord Himself,
that evil might fall upon them for their wicked deeds.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord 449,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Martian, being made emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
with Valentinian, the forty-sixth from Augustus, ruled the
Empire seven years. Then the nation of the Angles, or Saxons,
being invited by the aforesaid king, arrived in Britain with three
long ships, and had a place assigned them to reside in by the same
king, in the eastern part of the island,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> that they might thus
appear to be fighting for their country, while their real intentions
were to enslave it. Accordingly they engaged with the
enemy, who were come from the north to give battle, and obtained
the victory; which, being known at home in their own
country, as also the fertility of the islands and the cowardice of
the Britons, a larger fleet was quickly sent over, bringing a still
greater number of men, who, being added to the former, made
<span class="sidebar">The Saxons
settle in the
island</span>
up an invincible army. The newcomers received
from the Britons a place to dwell, upon condition
that they should wage war against their enemies
for the peace and security of the country, while the Britons
agreed to furnish them with pay.</p>

<p>Those who came over were of the three most powerful nations
of Germany&mdash;Saxons, Angles, and Jutes. From the Jutes are
descended the people of Kent and of the Isle of Wight, and
those also in the province of the West Saxons who are to this day
called Jutes, seated opposite to the Isle of Wight. From the
Saxons, that is, the country which is now called Old Saxony,
came the East Saxons, the South Saxons, and the West Saxons.
From the Angles, that is, the country which is called Anglia,
and which is said, from that time, to remain desert to this day,
between the provinces of the Jutes and the Saxons, are descended
the East Angles, the Midland Angles, Mercians, all the race of
the Northumbrians, that is, of those nations that dwell on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
north side of the River Humber, and the other nations of the
English.</p>

<p>The first two commanders are said to have been Hengist and
Horsa. Horsa, being afterwards slain in battle by the Britons,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
<span class="sidebar">Hengist and
Horsa</span>
was buried in the eastern part of Kent, where a
monument bearing his name is still in existence.
They were the sons of Victgilsus, whose father was Vecta, son
of Woden; from whose stock the royal races of many provinces
trace their descent. In a short time swarms of the aforesaid
nations came over into the island, and they began to increase so
much that they became a terror to the natives themselves who
had invited them. Then, having on a sudden entered into a
league with the Picts, whom they had by this time repelled by
<span class="sidebar">The Saxons
turn against
the Britons</span>
the force of their arms, they began to turn their
weapons against their confederates. At first
they obliged them to furnish a greater quantity
of provisions; and, seeking an occasion to quarrel, protested that
unless more plentiful supplies were brought them they would
break the confederacy and ravage all the island; nor were they
backward in putting their threats in execution.</p>

<p>They plundered all the neighboring cities and country, spread
the conflagration from the eastern to the western sea without
any opposition, and covered almost every part of the
island. Public as well as private structures were overturned;
<span class="sidebar">Their devastation
of the
country</span>
the priests were everywhere slain before the altars;
the prelates and the people, without any respect
of persons, were destroyed with fire and sword;
nor were there any to bury those who had been thus cruelly
slaughtered. Some of the miserable remainder, being taken in
the mountains, were butchered in heaps. Others, driven by
hunger, came forth and submitted themselves to the enemy for
food, being destined to undergo perpetual servitude, if they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
were not killed upon the spot. Some, with sorrowful hearts, fled
beyond the seas. Others, continuing in their own country, led
a miserable life among the woods, rocks, and mountains, with
scarcely enough food to support life, and expecting every moment
to be their last.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<h4>9. The Mission of Augustine (597)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>How or when the Christian religion was first introduced into Britain
cannot now be ascertained. As early as the beginning of the third
century the African church father Tertullian referred to the Britons
as a Christian people, and in 314 the British church was recognized
by the Council of Arles as an integral part of the church universal.
Throughout the period of Roman control in the island Christianity
continued to be the dominant religion. When, however, in the fifth
century and after, the Saxons and Angles invaded the country and
the native population was largely killed off or driven westward (though
not so completely as some books tell us), Christianity came to be pretty
much confined to the Celtic peoples of Ireland and Wales. The invaders
were still pagans worshiping the old Teutonic deities Woden,
Thor, Freya, and the rest, and though an attempt at their conversion
was made by a succession of Irish monks, their pride as conquerors
seems to have kept them from being greatly influenced. At any rate,
the conversion of the Angles and Saxons was a task which called for
a special evangelistic movement from no less a source than the head
of the Church. This movement was set in operation by Pope Gregory I.
(Gregory the Great) near the close of the sixth century. It is reasonable
to suppose that the impulse came originally from Bertha, the
Frankish queen of King Ethelbert of Kent, who was an ardent Christian
and very desirous of bringing about the conversion of her adopted
people. In 596 Augustine (not to be confused with the celebrated
bishop of Hippo in the fifth century) was sent by Pope Gregory at the
head of a band of monks to proclaim the religion of the cross to King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Ethelbert, and afterwards to all the Angles and Saxons and Jutes in
the island. On Whitsunday, June 2, 597, Ethelbert renounced his old
gods and was baptized into the Christian communion. The majority
of his people soon followed his example and four years later Augustine
was appointed "Bishop of the English." After this encouraging beginning
the Christianizing of the East, West, and South Saxons went
steadily forward.</p>

and piety, was elected to the apostolical see of Rome, and

missionaries
to Britain</span>
being moved by divine inspiration, in the fourteenth
year of the same emperor, and about the
one hundred and fiftieth after the coming of the
English into Britain, sent the servant of God, Augustine,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and
with him several other monks who feared the Lord, to preach
the word of God to the English nation. They, in obedience to
the Pope's commands, having undertaken that work, were on
their journey seized with a sudden fear and began to think of
returning home, rather than of proceeding to a barbarous,
fierce, and unbelieving nation, to whose very language they
<span class="sidebar">They become
frightened at
the outlook</span>
were strangers; and this they unanimously
agreed was the safest course.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> In short, they
sent back Augustine, who had been appointed
to be consecrated bishop in case they were received by the English,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
that he might, by humble entreaty, obtain consent of the
holy Gregory, that they should not be compelled to undertake
so dangerous, toilsome, and uncertain a journey. The Pope, in
reply, sent them an encouraging letter, persuading them to proceed
in the work of the divine word, and rely on the assistance of
the Almighty. The substance of this letter was as follows:</p>

<p>"Gregory, the servant of the servants of God, to the servants
of our Lord. Forasmuch as it had been better not to begin a
good work than to think of abandoning that
<span class="sidebar">Gregory's letter
of encouragement</span>
which has been begun, it behooves you, my
beloved sons, to fulfill the good work which, by
the help of our Lord, you have undertaken. Let not, therefore,
the toil of the journey nor the tongues of evil-speaking men deter
you. With all possible earnestness and zeal perform that which,
by God's direction, you have undertaken; being assured that
much labor is followed by an eternal reward. When Augustine,
your chief, returns, whom we also constitute your abbot,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> humbly
obey him in all things; knowing that whatsoever you shall do by
his direction will, in all respects, be helpful to your souls. Almighty
God protect you with his grace, and grant that I, in the
heavenly country, may see the fruits of your labor; inasmuch as,
though I cannot labor with you, I shall partake in the joy of the
reward, because I am willing to labor. God keep you in safety,
my most beloved sons. Dated the 23rd of July, in the fourteenth
year of the reign of our pious and most august lord, Mauritius
Tiberius, the thirteenth year after the consulship of our said
lord."</p>

<p>Augustine, thus strengthened by the confirmation of the
blessed Father Gregory, returned to the work of the word of
God, with the servants of Christ, and arrived in Britain. The
powerful Ethelbert was at that time king of Kent. He had extended
his dominions as far as the great River Humber, by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the Southern Saxons are divided from the Northern.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> On the
east of Kent is the large isle of Thanet containing according to
<span class="sidebar">Augustine
and his companions
arrive
in Kent</span>

the English reckoning 600 families, divided from
the other land by the River Wantsum, which is
about three furlongs over and fordable only in
two places, for both ends of it run into the sea.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> In this island
landed the servant of our Lord, Augustine, and his companions,
being, as is reported, nearly forty men. By order of the blessed
Pope Gregory, they had taken interpreters of the nation of
the Franks,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and sending to Ethelbert, signified that they were
come from Rome and brought a joyful message, which most undoubtedly
assured to all that took advantage of it everlasting
joys in heaven and a kingdom that would never end, with the
living and true God. The king, having heard this, ordered that
they stay in that island where they had landed, and that they
be furnished with all necessaries, until he should consider what
to do with them. For he had before heard of the Christian religion,
having a Christian wife of the royal family of the Franks,
called Bertha;<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> whom he had received from her parents upon
condition that she should be permitted to practice her religion
with the Bishop Luidhard, who was sent with her to preserve
her faith.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Some days after, the king came to the island, and sitting in
the open air, ordered Augustine and his companions to be brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
into his presence. For he had taken precaution that they should
not come to him in any house, lest, according to an ancient superstition,
if they practised any magical arts, they might impose
upon him, and so get the better of him. But they came furnished
with divine, not with magic virtue, bearing a silver cross for
their banner, and the image of our Lord and Savior painted on a
board; and singing the litany, they offered up their prayers to
the Lord for the eternal salvation both of themselves and of
<span class="sidebar">Augustine
preaches to
King Ethelbert</span>
those to whom they were come. When Augustine
had sat down, according to the king's commands,
and preached to him and his attendants there
present the word of life, the king answered thus: "Your words
and promises are very fair, but as they are new to us, and of
uncertain import, I cannot approve of them so far as to forsake
that which I have so long followed with the whole English nation.
But because you are come from afar into my kingdom, and, as I
conceive, are desirous to impart to us those things which you
believe to be true and most beneficial, we will not molest you,
but give you favorable entertainment and take care to supply
you with necessary sustenance; nor do we forbid you to
preach and win as many as you can to your religion." Accordingly
he permitted them to reside in the city of Canterbury,
which was the metropolis of all his dominions, and, according to
his promise, besides allowing them sustenance, did not refuse
them liberty to preach. It is reported that, as they drew near
to the city, after their manner, with the holy cross and the image
of our sovereign Lord and King, Jesus Christ, they sang this
litany together: "We beseech thee, O Lord, in all Thy mercy,
that Thy anger and wrath be turned away from this city, and
from Thy holy house, because we have sinned. Hallelujah."</p>

<p>As soon as they entered the dwelling-place assigned them,
they began to imitate the course of life practised in the primitive
Church; applying themselves to frequent prayer, watching,
and fasting; preaching the word of life to as many as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
they could; despising all worldly things as not belonging to them;
receiving only their necessary food from those they taught; living
<span class="sidebar">The life of the
missionaries at
Canterbury</span>

themselves in all respects in conformity with
what they prescribed for others, and being always
disposed to suffer any adversity, and even to die
for that truth which they preached. In short, several believed
and were baptized, admiring the simplicity of their innocent life,
and the sweetness of their heavenly doctrine. There was, on the
east side of the city, a church dedicated to the honor of St. Martin,
built whilst the Romans were still in the island, wherein the
queen, who, as has been said before, was a Christian, used to
pray.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> In this they first began to meet, to sing, to pray, to say
mass, to preach, and to baptize, until the king, being converted
to the faith, allowed them to preach openly, and build or repair
churches in all places.</p>

<p>When he, among the rest, induced by the unspotted life of
these holy men, and their pleasing promises, which by many
<span class="sidebar">Ethelbert
converted</span>
miracles they proved to be most certain, believed
and was baptized, greater numbers began daily to
flock together to hear the word, and forsaking their heathen rites,
to associate themselves, by believing, to the unity of the church
of Christ. Their conversion the king encouraged in so far that
he compelled none to embrace Christianity, but only showed more
affection to the believers, as to his fellow-citizens in the heavenly
kingdom. For he had learned from his instructors and guides to
salvation that the service of Christ ought to be voluntary, not
by compulsion. Nor was it long before he gave his teachers a settled
residence in his metropolis of Canterbury, with such possessions
of different kinds as were necessary for their subsistence.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH</h3>

<h4>10. Pope Leo's Sermon on the Petrine Supremacy</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In tracing the history of the great ecclesiastical institution known
as the papacy, the first figure that stands out with considerable clearness
is that of Leo I., or Leo the Great, who was elected bishop of Rome
in the year 440. Leo is perhaps the first man who, all things considered,
can be called "pope" in the modern sense of the term, although
certain of his predecessors in the bishop's seat at the imperial capital had
long claimed and exercised a peculiar measure of authority over their
fellow bishops throughout the Empire. Almost from the earliest days
of Christianity the word <i>papa</i> (pope) seems to have been in common
use as an affectionate mode of addressing any bishop, but after the
fourth century it came to be applied in a peculiar manner to the bishop
of Rome, and in time this was the only usage, so far as western Europe
was concerned, which survived. The causes of the special development
of the Roman bishopric into the powerful papal office were numerous.
Rome's importance as a city, and particularly as the political head
of the Mediterranean world, made it natural that her bishop should
have something of a special dignity and influence. Throughout western
Europe the Roman church was regarded as a model and its bishop was
frequently called upon for counsel and advice. Then, when the seat
of the imperial government was removed to the East by Constantine,
the Roman bishop naturally took up much of the leadership in the West
which had been exercised by the emperor, and this added not a little in
the way of prestige. On the whole the Roman bishops were moderate,
liberal, and sensible in their attitude toward church questions, thereby
commending themselves to the practical peoples of the West in a way
that other bishops did not always do. The growth of temporal possessions,
especially in the way of land, also made the Roman bishops more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
independent and able to hold their own. And the activity of such men
as Leo the Great in warding off the attacks of the German barbarians,
and in providing popular leadership in the absence of such leadership
on the part of the imperial authorities, was a not unimportant item.</p>

<p>After all, however, these are matters which have always been regarded
by the popes themselves as circumstances of a more or less
transitory and accidental character. It is not upon any or all of them
that the papacy from first to last has sought to base its high claims
to authority. The fundamental explanation, from the papal standpoint,
for the peculiar development of the papal power in the person
of the bishops of Rome is contained in the so-called theory of the
"Petrine Supremacy," which will be found set forth in Pope Leo's
sermon reproduced in part below. The essential points in this theory
are: (1) that to the apostle Peter, Christ committed the keys of the
kingdom of heaven and the supremacy over all other apostles on earth;
(2) that Peter, in the course of time, became the first bishop of Rome;
and (3) that the superior authority given to Peter was transmitted to
all his successors in the Roman bishopric. It was fundamentally on
<i>these</i> grounds that the pope, to quote an able Catholic historian, was
believed to be "the visible representative of ecclesiastical unity, the
supreme teacher and custodian of the faith, the supreme legislator, the
guardian and interpreter of the canons, the legitimate superior of all
bishops, the final judge of councils&mdash;an office which he possessed in his
own right, and which he actually exercised by presiding over all ecumenical
synods, through his legates, and by confirming the acts of the
councils as the Supreme Head of the Universal Catholic Church."<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Modern Protestants discard certain of the tenets which go to make up
the Petrine theory, but it is essential that the student of history bear
in mind that the people of the Middle Ages never doubted its complete
and literal authenticity, nor questioned that the authority of the
papal office rested at bottom upon something far more fundamental than
a mere fortunate combination of historical circumstances. Whatever
one's personal opinions on the issues involved, the point to be insisted
upon is that in studying mediæval church life and organization the universal
acceptance of these beliefs and conclusions be never lost to view.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>Leo was pope from 440 to 461 and it has been well maintained that he
was the first occupant of the office to comprehend the wide possibilities
of the papal dignity in the future. In his sermons and letters he vigorously
asserted the sovereign authority of his position, and in his influence
on the events of his time, as for example the Council of Chalcedon
in 451, he sought with no little success to bring men to a general
acknowledgment of this authority.</p>

<p>Although, therefore, dearly beloved, we be found both weak
and slothful in fulfilling the duties of our office, because, whatever
devoted and vigorous action we desire to undertake, we are
hindered in by the frailty of our nature, yet having the unceasing
propitiation of the Almighty and perpetual Priest [Christ], who
being like us and yet equal with the Father, brought down His
Godhead even to things human, and raised His Manhood even
to things Divine, we worthily and piously rejoice over His dispensation,
whereby, though He has delegated the care of His
sheep to many shepherds, yet He has not Himself abandoned
the guardianship of His beloved flock. And from His overruling
<span class="sidebar">The apostle
Peter still with
his Church</span>

and eternal protection we have received the
support of the Apostle's aid also, which assuredly
does not cease from its operation; and the strength
of the foundation, on which the whole superstructure of the
Church is reared, is not weakened by the weight of the temple
that rests upon it. For the solidity of that faith which was
praised in the chief of the Apostles is perpetual; and as that
remains which Peter believed in Christ, so that remains which
Christ instituted in Peter.</p>

<p>For when, as has been read in the Gospel lesson,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the Lord
had asked the disciples whom they believed Him to be amid the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
various opinions that were held, and the blessed Peter had replied,
saying, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,"
<span class="sidebar">Christ's commission
to
Peter</span>

the Lord said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona,
because flesh and blood hath not revealed
it to thee, but My Father, which is in heaven.
And I say to thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I
build My church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against
it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in
heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be
loosed also in heaven." [Matt. xvi. 16-19.]</p>

<p>The dispensation of Truth therefore abides, and the blessed
Peter persevering in the strength of the Rock, which he has
received, has not abandoned the helm of the Church, which he
undertook. For he was ordained before the rest in such a way
that from his being called the Rock, from his being pronounced
the Foundation, from his being constituted the Doorkeeper of
the kingdom of heaven, from his being set as the Umpire to bind
and to loose, whose judgments shall retain their validity in
<span class="sidebar">Peter properly
rules the
Church through
his successors
at Rome</span>

heaven&mdash;from all these mystical titles we might
know the nature of his association with Christ.
And still to-day he more fully and effectually
performs what is intrusted to him, and carries
out every part of his duty and charge in Him and with Him,
through whom he has been glorified. And so if anything is
rightly done and rightly decreed by us, if anything is won from
the mercy of God by our daily supplications, it is of his work and
merits whose power lives and whose authority prevails in his
see....<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>And so, dearly beloved, with becoming obedience we celebrate
to-day's festival<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> by such methods, that in my humble person he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
may be recognized and honored, in whom abides the care of all
the shepherds, together with the charge of the sheep commended
to him, and whose dignity is not belittled even in so unworthy an
<span class="sidebar">Leo claims to
be only Peter's
representative</span>

heir. And hence the presence of my venerable
brothers and fellow-priests, so much desired and
valued by me, will be the more sacred and
precious, if they will transfer the chief honor of this service in
which they have deigned to take part to him whom they know
to be not only the patron of this see, but also the primate of all
bishops. When therefore we utter our exhortations in your ears,
holy brethren, believe that he is speaking whose representative
we are. Because it is his warning that we give, and nothing else
but his teaching that we preach, beseeching you to "gird up the
loins of your mind," and lead a chaste and sober life in the fear of
God, and not to let your mind forget his supremacy and consent
to the lusts of the flesh.</p>

<p>Short and fleeting are the joys of this world's pleasures which
endeavor to turn aside from the path of life those who are called
to eternity. The faithful and religious spirit, therefore, must
desire the things which are heavenly and, being eager for the
<span class="sidebar">An exhortation
to Christian
constancy</span>
divine promises, lift itself to the love of the incorruptible
Good and the hope of the true Light.
But be assured, dearly-beloved, that your labor,
whereby you resist vices and fight against carnal desires, is
pleasing and precious in God's sight, and in God's mercy will
profit not only yourselves but me also, because the zealous
pastor makes his boast of the progress of the Lord's flock. "For
ye are my crown and joy," as the Apostle says, if your faith,
which from the beginning of the Gospel has been preached in all
<span class="sidebar">The peculiar
privilege of
the church at
Rome</span>
the world, has continued in love and holiness.
For though the whole Church, which is in all
the world, ought to abound in all virtues, yet you
especially, above all people, it becomes to excel in deeds of piety,
because, founded as you are on the very citadel of the Apostolic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Rock, not only has our Lord Jesus Christ redeemed you in common
with all men, but the blessed Apostle Peter has instructed
you far beyond all men.</p>

<h4>11. The Rule of St. Benedict</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>A very important feature of the church life of the early Middle Ages
was the tendency of devout men to withdraw from the active affairs
of the world and give themselves up to careers of self-sacrificing piety.
Sometimes such men went out to live alone in forests or other obscure
places and for this reason were called anchorites or hermits; but more
often they settled in groups and formed what came to be known as
monasteries. The idea that seclusion is helpful to the religious life was
not peculiar to Christianity, for from very early times Brahmins and
Buddhists and other peoples of the Orient had cherished the same
view; and in many cases they do so still. Monasticism among Christians
began naturally in the East and at first took the form almost wholly
of hermitage, just as it had done among the adherents of other Oriental
religions, though by the fourth century the Christian monks of Syria
and Egypt and Asia Minor had come in many cases to dwell in established
communities. In general the Eastern monks were prone to extremes
in the way of penance and self-torture which the more practical
peoples of the West were not greatly disposed to imitate. Monasticism
spread into the West, but not until comparatively late&mdash;beginning in
the second half of the fourth century&mdash;and the character which it there
assumed was quite unlike that prevailing in the East. The Eastern ideal
was the life of meditation with as little activity as possible, except perhaps
such as was necessary in order to impose hardships upon one's self.
The Western ideal, on the other hand, while involving a good deal of
meditation and prayer, put much emphasis on labor and did not call
for so complete an abstention of the monk from the pursuits and pleasures
of other men.</p>

<p>In the later fifth century, and earlier sixth, several monasteries of
whose history we know little were established in southern Gaul, especially
in the pleasant valley of the Rhone. Earliest of all, apparently,
and destined to become the most influential was the abbey of St. Martin
at Tours, founded soon after St. Martin was made bishop of Tours in 372.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
But the development of Western monasticism is associated most of all
with the work of St. Benedict of Nursia, who died in 543. Benedict was
the founder of several monasteries in the vicinity of Rome, the most important
being that of Monte Cassino, on the road from Rome to Naples,
which exists to this day. One should guard, however, against the mistake
of looking upon St. Benedict as the introducer of monasticism in the
West, of even as the founder of a new monastic <i>order</i> in the strict sense of
the word. The great service which he rendered to European monasticism
consisted in his working out for his monasteries in Italy an elaborate
system of government which was found so successful in practice that,
in the form of the Benedictine Rule (<i>regula</i>), it came to be the constitution
under which for many centuries practically all the monks of Western
countries lived. That it was so widely adopted was due mainly
to its definite, practical, common-sense character. Its chief injunctions
upon the monks were poverty, chastity, obedience, piety, and labor.
All these were to be attained by methods which, although they may
seem strange to us to-day, were at least natural and wholesome when
judged by the ideas and standards prevailing in early mediæval times.
Granted the ascetic principle upon which the monastic system rested,
the Rule of St. Benedict must be regarded as eminently moderate and
sensible. It sprang from an acute perception of human nature and
human needs no less than from a lofty ideal of religious perfection.
The following extracts will serve to show its character.</p>
</div>

Series, Vol. LXVI., cols. 245-932 <i>passim</i>. Adapted from translation
in Ernest F. Henderson, <i>Select Historical Documents of the
Middle Ages</i> (London, 1896), pp. 274-314.</p>

<p><i>Prologue....</i> We are about to found, therefore, a school
for the Lord's service, in the organization of which we trust that
we shall ordain nothing severe and nothing burdensome. But
even if, the demands of justice dictating it, something a trifle
irksome shall be the result, for the purpose of amending vices or
preserving charity, thou shalt not therefore, struck by fear, flee
the way of salvation, which cannot be entered upon except
through a narrow entrance.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> <i>What the abbot should be like.</i> An abbot who is worthy to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
preside over a monastery ought always to remember what he is
called, and carry out with his deeds the name of a Superior.
For he is believed to be Christ's representative, since he is called
by His name, the apostle saying: "Ye have received the spirit of
adoption of sons, whereby we call Abba, Father" [Romans viii.
15]. And so the abbot should not (grant that he may not) teach,
or decree, or order, anything apart from the precept of the Lord;
but his order or teaching should be characterized by the marks
of divine justice in the minds of his disciples. Let the abbot
<span class="sidebar">Responsibility
of the abbot
for the character
and deeds
of the monks</span>

always be mindful that, at the terrible judgment
of God, both things will be weighed in the balance,
his teaching and the obedience of his disciples.
And let the abbot know that whatever of uselessness
the father of the family finds among the sheep is laid to
the fault of the shepherd. Only in a case where the whole diligence
of their pastor shall have been bestowed on an unruly and
disobedient flock, and his whole care given to their wrongful
actions, shall that pastor, absolved in the judgment of the Lord,
be free to say to the Lord with the prophet: "I have not hid Thy
righteousness within my heart; I have declared Thy faithfulness
and Thy salvation, but they, despising, have scorned me" [Psalms
xl. 10]. And then let the punishment for the disobedient
sheep under his care be that death itself shall prevail against
<span class="sidebar">He must teach
by example as
well as by precept</span>

them. Therefore, when any one receives the name
of abbot, he ought to rule over his disciples with
a double teaching; that is, let him show forth all
good and holy things by deeds more than by words. So that to
ready disciples he may set forth the commands of God in words;
but to the hard-hearted and the more simple-minded, he may
show forth the divine precepts by his deeds.</p>

<p>He shall make no distinction of persons in the monastery.
One shall not be more cherished than another, unless it be the
one whom he finds excelling in good works or in obedience. A
free-born man shall not be preferred to one coming from servitude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
unless there be some other reasonable cause. But if, by
the demand of justice, it seems good to the abbot, he shall do
this, no matter what the rank shall be. But otherwise they shall
keep their own places. For whether we be bond or free, we are all
<span class="sidebar">His duty to encourage,
to admonish,
and to
punish</span>

one in Christ; and, under one God, we perform an
equal service of subjection. For God is no respecter
of persons. Only in this way is a distinction
made by Him concerning us, if we are found humble
and surpassing others in good works. Therefore let him [the
abbot] have equal charity for all. Let the same discipline be
administered in all cases according to merit.... He
should, that is, rebuke more severely the unruly and the turbulent.
The obedient, moreover, and the gentle and the patient,
he should exhort, that they may progress to higher things.
But the negligent and scorners, we warn him to admonish and
reprove. Nor let him conceal the sins of the erring; but, in order
that he may prevail, let him pluck them out by the roots as soon
as they begin to spring up.</p>

<p>And let him know what a difficult and arduous thing he has
undertaken&mdash;to rule the souls and uplift the morals of many.
And in one case indeed with blandishments, in another with rebukes,
in another with persuasion&mdash;according to the quality
or intelligence of each one&mdash;he shall so conform and adapt
himself to all that not only shall he not allow injury to come to
the flock committed to him, but he shall rejoice in the increase
of a good flock. Above all things, let him not, deceiving himself
or undervaluing the safety of the souls committed to him, give
more heed to temporary and earthly and passing things; but let
him always reflect that he has undertaken to rule souls for which
he is to render account.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> <i>About calling in the brethren to take counsel.</i> Whenever
anything of importance is to be done in the monastery, the abbot
shall call together the whole congregation,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and shall himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
explain the matter in question. And, having heard the advice
of the brethren, he shall think it over by himself, and shall do
<span class="sidebar">The monks to
be consulted
by the abbot</span>

what he considers most advantageous. And for
this reason, moreover, we have said that all
ought to be called to take counsel, because often
it is to a younger person that God reveals what is best. The
brethren, moreover, with all subjection of humility, ought so to
give their advice that they do not presume boldly to defend
what seems good to them; but it should rather depend on the
judgment of the abbot, so that, whatever he decides to be best,
they should all agree to it. But even as it behooves the disciples
to obey the master, so it is fitting that he should arrange
all matters with care and justice. In all things, indeed, let
<span class="sidebar">The Rule to be
followed by
every one as a
guide</span>

every one follow the Rule as his guide; and let
no one rashly deviate from it. Let no one
in the monastery follow the inclination of his
own heart. And let no one boldly presume to dispute with
his abbot, within or without the monastery. But, if he
should so presume, let him be subject to the discipline of the
Rule.</p>

<p><b>33.</b> <i>Whether the monks should have anything of their own.</i>
More than anything else is this special vice to be cut off root and
<span class="sidebar">No property to
be owned by
the monks individually</span>

branch from the monastery, that one should presume
to give or receive anything without the
order of the abbot, or should have anything of
his own. He should have absolutely not anything, neither a
book, nor tablets, nor a pen&mdash;nothing at all. For indeed it is
not allowed to the monks to have their own bodies or wills in
their own power. But all things necessary they must expect
from the Father of the monastery; nor is it allowable to have
anything which the abbot has not given or permitted. All
things shall be held in common; as it is written, "Let not any

fourth hour they shall do what labor may be necessary. From
<span class="sidebar">Daily schedule
for the summer
season</span>

the fourth hour until about the sixth, they shall
be free for reading. After the meal of the sixth
hour, rising from the table, they shall rest in their
beds with all silence; or, perchance, he that wishes to read may
read to himself in such a way as not to disturb another. And
the <i>nona</i> [the second meal] shall be gone through with more
moderately about the middle of the eighth hour; and again they
shall work at what is to be done until Vespers.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> But, if the emergency
or poverty of the place demands that they be occupied in
picking fruits, they shall not be grieved; for they are truly monks
if they live by the labors of their hands, as did also our fathers
and the apostles. Let all things be done with moderation, however,
on account of the faint-hearted.</p>

<p>In days of Lent they shall all receive separate books from the
library, which they shall read entirely through in order. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
books are to be given out on the first day of Lent. Above all
there shall be appointed without fail one or two elders, who shall
<span class="sidebar">Reading during

go round the monastery at the hours in which the
brothers are engaged in reading, and see to it that
no troublesome brother be found who is given to idleness and
trifling, and is not intent on his reading, being not only of no use
to himself, but also stirring up others. If such a one (may it not
happen) be found, he shall be reproved once and a second time.
If he do not amend, he shall be subject under the Rule to such
punishment that the others may have fear. Nor shall brother
join brother at unsuitable hours. Moreover, on Sunday all shall
engage in reading, excepting those who are assigned to various
duties. But if any one be so negligent and lazy that he will not
or can not read, some task shall be imposed upon him which he
can do, so that he be not idle. On feeble or delicate brothers
such a task or art is to be imposed, that they shall neither be idle
nor so oppressed by the violence of labor as to be driven to take
flight. Their weakness is to be taken into consideration by the
abbot.</p>

<p><b>53.</b> <i>Concerning the reception of guests.</i> All guests who come

xxv. 35]. And to all fitting honor shall be
shown; but, most of all, to servants of the faith and to pilgrims.
When, therefore, a guest is announced, the prior or the brothers
shall run to meet him, with every token of love. And first they
shall pray together, and thus they shall be joined together in
peace.</p>

<p><b>54.</b> <i>Whether a monk should be allowed to receive letters or anything.</i>
By no means shall it be allowed to a monk&mdash;either from
his relatives, or from any man, or from one of his fellows&mdash;to
receive or to give, without order of the abbot, letters, presents, or
any gift, however small. But even if, by his relatives, anything
has been sent to him, he shall not presume to receive it, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
it has first been shown to the abbot. But if the latter order

to whomsoever he wishes. And the brother to

be displeased; that an opportunity be not given
to the devil. Whoever, moreover, presumes to do otherwise
shall be subject to the discipline of the Rule.</p>

<h4>12. Gregory the Great on the Life of the Pastor</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Gregory the Great, whose papacy extended from 590 to 604, was a
Roman of noble and wealthy family, and in many ways the ablest man
who had yet risen to the papal office. The date of his birth is not recorded,
but it was probably about 540, some ten years after St. Benedict
of Nursia had established his monastery at Monte Cassino. He was
therefore a contemporary of the historian Gregory of Tours [see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>].
The education which he received was that which was usual with young
Romans of his rank in life, and it is said that in grammar, rhetoric, logic,
and law he became well versed, though without any claim to unusual
scholarship. He entered public life and in 570 was made prætor of the
city of Rome. All the time, however, he was struggling with the strange
attractiveness which the life of the monk had for him, and in the end,
upon the death of his father, he decided to forego the career to which his
wealth and rank entitled him and to seek the development of his higher
nature in seclusion. With the money obtained from the sale of his great
estates he established six monasteries in Sicily and that of St. Andrew
at Rome. In Gregory's case, however, retirement to monastic life did
not mean oblivion, for soon he was selected by Pope Pelagius II., as
resident minister (<i>apocrisiarius</i>) at Constantinople and in this important
position he was maintained for five or six years. After returning
to Rome he became abbot of St. Andrews, and in 590, as the records
say, he was "demanded" as pope.</p>

<p>Gregory was a man of very unusual ability and the force of his strong
personality made his reign one of the great formative epochs in papal
history. Besides his activity in relation to the affairs of the world in
general, he has the distinction of being a literary pope. His letters
and treatises were numerous and possessed a quality of thought and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
style which was exceedingly rare in his day. The most famous of his
writings, and justly so, is the <i>Liber Regulæ Pastoralis</i>, known commonly
to English readers as the "Pastoral Care," or the "Pastoral Rule."
This book was written soon after its author became pope (590) and was
addressed to John, bishop of Ravenna, in reply to inquiries received
from him respecting the duties and obligations of the clergy. Though
thus put into form for a special purpose, there can be no doubt that
it was the product of long thought, and in fact in his <i>Magna Moralia</i>,
or "Commentary on the Book of Job," written during his residence at
Constantinople, Gregory declared his purpose some day to write just
such a book. Everywhere throughout Europe the work was received
with the favor it deserved, and in Spain, Gaul, and Italy its influence
upon the life and manners of the clergy was beyond estimate. Even
in Britain, after King Alfred's paraphrase of it in the Saxon tongue
had been made, three hundred years later [see <a href="#Page_193">p. 193</a>], it was a real
power for good. The permanent value of Gregory's instructions regarding
the life of the clergy arose not only from the lofty spirit in
which they were conceived and the clear-cut manner in which they
were expressed, but from their breadth and adaptation to all times and
places. There are few books which the modern pastor can read with
greater profit. The work is in four parts: (1) on the selection of men
for the work of the Church; (2) on the sort of life the pastor ought to
live; (3) on the best methods of dealing with the various types of people
which every pastor will be likely to encounter; and (4) on the necessity
that the pastor guard himself against egotism and personal ambition.
The passages below are taken from the second and third parts.</p>

<p>The conduct of a prelate<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> ought so far to be superior to the
conduct of the people as the life of a shepherd is accustomed to
exalt him above the flock. For one whose position is such that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the people are called his flock ought anxiously to consider how
great a necessity is laid upon him to maintain uprightness. It
<span class="sidebar">The qualities
which ought to
be united in
the pastor</span>

is necessary, then, that in thought he should be
pure, in action firm; discreet in keeping silence,
profitable in speech; a near neighbor to every one
in sympathy, exalted above all in contemplation; a familiar friend
of good livers through humility, unbending against the vices of
evil-doers through zeal for righteousness; not relaxing in his care
for what is inward by reason of being occupied in outward things,
nor neglecting to provide for outward things in his anxiety for
what is inward.</p>

<p>The ruler should always be pure in thought, inasmuch as no
impurity ought to pollute him who has undertaken the office
<span class="sidebar">Purity of heart
essential</span>

of wiping away the stains of pollution in the
hearts of others also; for the hand that would
cleanse from dirt must needs be clean, lest, being itself sordid
with clinging mire, it soil all the more whatever it touches.</p>

<p>The ruler should always be a leader in action, that by his living
he may point out the way of life to those who are put under him,
<span class="sidebar">He must teach
by example</span>

and that the flock, which follows the voice and
manners of the shepherd, may learn how to walk
rather through example than through words. For he who is
required by the necessity of his position to <i>speak</i> the highest
things is compelled by the same necessity to <i>do</i> the highest
things. For that voice more readily penetrates the hearer's
heart, which the speaker's life commends, since what he commands
by speaking he helps the doing by showing.</p>

<p>The ruler should be discreet in keeping silence, profitable in
speech; lest he either utter what ought to be suppressed or suppress
what he ought to utter. For, as incautious speaking leads
into error, so indiscreet silence leaves in error those who might
have been instructed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>The ruler ought also to understand how commonly vices pass
themselves off as virtues. For often niggardliness excuses itself
under the name of frugality, and on the other hand extravagance
conceals itself under the name of liberality. Often inordinate
carelessness is believed to be loving-kindness, and unbridled
wrath is accounted the virtue of spiritual zeal. Often hasty
action is taken for promptness, and tardiness for the deliberation
<span class="sidebar">He must be
able to distinguish
virtues
and vices</span>
of seriousness. Whence it is necessary for the
ruler of souls to distinguish with vigilant care
between virtues and vices, lest stinginess get
possession of his heart while he exults in seeming frugality in
expenditure; or, while anything is recklessly wasted, he glory in
being, as it were, compassionately liberal; or, in overlooking what
he ought to have smitten, he draw on those that are under him
to eternal punishment; or, in mercilessly smiting an offense, he
himself offend more grievously; or, by rashly anticipating, mar
what might have been done properly and gravely; or, by putting
off the merit of a good action, change it to something worse.</p>

<p>Since, then, we have shown what manner of man the pastor
ought to be, let us now set forth after what manner he should
<span class="sidebar">No one kind
of teaching
adapted to
all men</span>

teach. For, as long before us Gregory Nazianzen,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
of reverend memory, has taught, one and
the same exhortation does not suit all, inasmuch
as all are not bound together by similarity of character. For
the things that profit some often hurt others; seeing that also,
for the most part, herbs which nourish some animals are fatal to
others; and the gentle hissing that quiets horses incites whelps;
and the medicine which abates one disease aggravates another;
and the food which invigorates the life of the strong kills little
children. Therefore, according to the quality of the hearers
ought the discourse of teachers to be fashioned, so as to suit all
and each for their several needs, and yet never deviate from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
art of common edification. For what are the intent minds of
hearers but, so to speak, a kind of harp, which the skilful player,
in order to produce a tune possessing harmony, strikes in various
ways? And for this reason the strings render back a melodious
sound, because they are struck indeed with one quill, but not
with one kind of stroke. Whence every teacher also, that he
may edify all in the one virtue of charity, ought to touch the
hearts of his hearers out of one doctrine, but not with one and
the same exhortation.</p>

<p>Differently to be admonished are these that follow:</p>

<p>Men and women.</p>

<p>The poor and the rich.</p>

<p>The joyful and the sad.</p>

<p>Prelates and subordinates.</p>

<p>Servants and masters.</p>

<p>The wise of this world and the dull.
<span class="sidebar">Various classes
of hearers
to be distinguished</span>
</p>

<p>The impudent and the bashful.</p>

<p>The forward and the faint-hearted.</p>

<p>The impatient and the patient.</p>

<p>The kindly disposed and the envious.</p>

<p>The simple and the insincere.</p>

<p>The whole and the sick.</p>

<p>Those who fear scourges, and therefore live innocently; and
those who have grown so hard in iniquity as not to be corrected
even by scourges.</p>

<p>The too silent, and those who spend time in much speaking.</p>

<p>The slothful and the hasty.</p>

<p>The obstinate and the fickle.</p>

<p>Those who mercifully give of their own, and those who would
fain seize what belongs to others.</p>

<p>Those who neither seize the things of others nor are bountiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
with their own; and those who both give away the things they
have, and yet cease not to seize the things of others.</p>

<p>Those who are at variance, and those who are at peace.</p>

<p>Lovers of strife and peacemakers.</p>

<p>Those who understand not aright the words of sacred law;
and those who understand them indeed aright, but speak them
without humility.</p>

<p>Those who, though able to preach worthily, are afraid through
excessive humility; and those whom imperfection or age debars
from preaching, and yet rashness impels to it.</p>

<p>(Admonition 7)<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. Differently to be admonished are the wise of
this world and the dull. For the wise are to be admonished that
they leave off knowing what they know<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>; the dull also are to be
admonished that they seek to know what they know not. In
the former this thing first, that they think themselves wise, is to
be overcome; in the latter, whatsoever is already known of
<span class="sidebar">How the wise
and the dull
are to be admonished</span>

heavenly wisdom is to be built up; since, being in
no wise proud, they have, as it were, prepared
their hearts for supporting a building. With
those we should labor that they become more wisely foolish<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>,
leave foolish wisdom, and learn the wise foolishness of God: to
these we should preach that from what is accounted foolishness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
they should pass, as from a nearer neighborhood, to true
wisdom.</p>

<p>But in the midst of these things we are brought back by the
earnest desire of charity to what we have already said above;
that every preacher should give forth a sound more by his deeds
than by his words, and rather by good living imprint footsteps
for men to follow than by speaking show them the way to walk
in. For that cock, too, whom the Lord in his manner of speech
takes to represent a good preacher, when he is now preparing to
crow, first shakes his wings, and by smiting himself makes himself
more awake; since it is surely necessary that those who give
utterance to words of holy preaching should first be well awake
<span class="sidebar">Emphasis on
the importance
of setting a
right example</span>

in earnestness of good living, lest they arouse
others with their voice while themselves torpid
in performance; that they should first shake
themselves up by lofty deeds, and then make others solicitous
for good living; that they should first smite themselves with the
wings of their thoughts; that whatsoever in themselves is unprofitably
torpid they should discover by anxious investigation,
and correct by strict self-discipline, and then at length set in
order the life of others by speaking; that they should take heed
to punish their own faults by bewailings, and then denounce
what calls for punishment in others; and that, before they give
voice to words of exhortation, they should proclaim in their
deeds all that they are about to speak.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
THE RISE OF MOHAMMEDANISM</h3>

<h4>13. Selections from the Koran</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The Koran comprises all of the recorded speeches and sayings of
the prophet Mohammed and it has for nearly fifteen centuries been the
absolute law and gospel of the Mohammedan religion. The teachings
and revelations which are contained in it are believed by Mohammedans
to have proceeded directly from God. They were delivered orally by
Mohammed from time to time in the presence of his followers and
until after the prophet's death in 632 no attempt was made to put them
in organized written form. Many of the disciples, however, remembered
the words their master had uttered, at least until they could inscribe
them on palm leaves, bits of wood, bleached bones, or other such
articles as happened to be at hand. In the reign of Abu-Bekr (632-634),
Mohammed's successor, it became apparent that unless some measure
was adopted to bring these scattered sayings together they were in a
fair way to be lost for all time to come. Hence the caliph intrusted to
a certain young man by the name of Zaid the task of collecting and
putting in some sort of system all the teachings that had survived,
whether in written form or merely in the minds of men. Zaid had
served Mohammed in a capacity which we should designate perhaps
as that of secretary, and so should have been well qualified for the
work. In later years (about 660) the Koran, or "the reading," as the
collection began to be called, was again thoroughly revised. Thereafter
all older copies were destroyed and no farther changes in any
respect were ever made.</p>

<p>The Koran is made up of one hundred and fourteen chapters, called
<i>surahs</i>, arranged loosely in the order of their length, beginning with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the longest. This arrangement does not correspond either to the dates
at which the various passages were uttered by the prophet or to any
sequence of thought and meaning, so that when one takes up the book
to read it as it is ordinarily printed it seems about as confused as anything
can well be. Scholars, however, have recently discovered the
chronological order of the various parts and this knowledge has already
come to be of no little assistance in the work of interpretation. Like
all sacred books, the Koran abounds in repetitions; yet, taken all in
all, it contains not more than two-thirds as many verses as the New
Testament, and, as one writer has rather curiously observed, it is not
more than one-third as lengthy as the ordinary Sunday edition of the
New York <i>Herald</i>. The teachings which are most emphasized are (1)
the unity and greatness of God, (2) the sin of worshipping idols, (3)
the certainty of the resurrection of the body and the last judgment,
(4) the necessity of a belief in the Scriptures as revelations from God
communicated through angels to the line of prophets, (5) the luxuries
of heaven and the torments of hell, (6) the doctrine of predestination,
(7) the authoritativeness of Mohammed's teachings, and (8) the four
cardinal obligations of worship (including purification and prayer),
fasting, pilgrimages, and alms-giving. Intermingled with these are
numerous popular legends and sayings of the Arabs before Mohammed's
day, stories from the Old and New Testaments derived from Jewish
and Christian settlers in Arabia, and certain definite and practical
rules of everyday conduct. The book is not only thus haphazard in
subject-matter but it is also very irregular in interest and elegance.
Portions of it abound in splendid imagery and lofty conceptions, and
represent the literary quality of the Arabian language at its best, though
of course this quality is very largely lost in translation. The later
surahs&mdash;those which appear first in the printed copy&mdash;are largely argumentative
and legislative in character and naturally fall into a more
prosaic and monotonous strain. From an almost inexhaustible maze
of precepts, exhortations, and revelations, the following widely separated
passages have been selected in the hope that they will serve to
show something of the character of the Koran itself, as well as the
nature of some of the more important Mohammedan beliefs and ideals.
It will be found profitable to make a comparison of Christian beliefs
on the same points as drawn from the New Testament.

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
THE BEGINNINGS OF THE CAROLINGIAN DYNASTY OF FRANKISH
KINGS</h3>
<h4>14. Pepin the Short Takes the Title of King (751)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>During the seventh and eighth centuries the Merovingian line of
Frankish kings degenerated to a condition of weakness both pitiable
and ridiculous. As the royal family became less worthy, the powers of
government gradually slipped from its hands into those of a series of
ministers commonly known by the title of Mayor of the Palace (<i>Maior
Domus</i>). The most illustrious of these uncrowned sovereigns was
Charles Martel, the victor over the Saracens near Poitiers, in whose
time the Frankish throne for four years had no occupant at all. Martel
contrived to make his peculiar office hereditary, and at his death in
741 left it to be filled jointly by his two elder sons, Karlmann and
Pepin the Short. They decided that it would be to their interest to
keep up the show of Merovingian royalty a little longer and in 743
allowed Childeric III. to mount the throne&mdash;a weakling destined to
be the last of his family to wear the Frankish crown. Four years later
Karlmann renounced his office and withdrew to the monastery of
Monte Cassino, southeast of Rome, leaving Pepin sole "mayor" and
the only real ruler of the Franks. Before many more years had passed,
the utter uselessness of keeping up a royal line whose members were
notoriously unfit to govern had impressed itself upon the nation to
such an extent that when Pepin proceeded to put young Childeric in
a monastery and take the title of king for himself, nobody offered the
slightest objection. The sanction of the Pope was obtained for the act
because Pepin thought that his course would thus be made to appear
less like an outright usurpation. The Pope's reward came four years
later when Pepin bestowed upon him the lands in northern and central
Italy which eventually constituted, in the main, the so-called States of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the Church. In later times, after the reign of Pepin's famous son
Charlemagne, the new dynasty established by Pepin's elevation to the
throne came to be known as the Carolingian (from <i>Karolus</i>, or Charles).</p>

<p>The following account of the change from the Merovingian to the
Carolingian line is taken from the so-called <i>Lesser Annals of Lorsch</i>.
At the monastery of Lorsch, as at nearly every other such place in the
Middle Ages, records or "annals" of one sort or another were pretty
regularly kept. They were often very inaccurate and their writers
had a curious way of filling up space with matters of little importance,
but sometimes, as in the present instance, we can get from them some
very interesting information. The monastery of Lorsch was about
twelve miles distant from Heidelberg, in southern Germany.</p>

<p>In the year 750<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> of the Lord's incarnation Pepin sent ambassadors
to Rome to Pope Zacharias,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> to inquire concerning the kings
of the Franks who, though they were of the royal line and were
called kings, had no power in the kingdom, except that charters
and privileges were drawn up in their names. They had absolutely
no kingly authority, but did whatever the Major Domus of
the Franks desired.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> But on the first day of March in the Campus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Martius,<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> according to ancient custom, gifts were offered to these
kings by the people, and the king himself sat in the royal seat
with the army standing round him and the Major Domus in his
presence, and he commanded on that day whatever was decreed
by the Franks; but on all other days thenceforward he remained
quietly at home. Pope Zacharias, therefore, in the exercise of his
apostolic authority, replied to their inquiry that it seemed to him
better and more expedient that the man who held power in the
kingdom should be called king and be king, rather than he
who falsely bore that name. Therefore the aforesaid pope commanded
the king and people of the Franks that Pepin, who was
exercising royal power, should be called king, and should be established
on the throne. This was therefore done by the anointing
of the holy archbishop Boniface in the city of Soissons. Pepin
was proclaimed king, and Childeric, who was falsely called king,
was shaved and sent into a monastery.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />
THE AGE OF CHARLEMAGNE</h3>

<h4>15. Charlemagne the Man</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Biographical writings make up a not inconsiderable part of mediæval
literature, but unfortunately the greater portion of them are
to be trusted in only a limited degree by the student of history. Many
biographies, especially the lives of the saints and other noted Christian
leaders, were prepared expressly for the purpose of giving the world
concrete examples of how men ought to live. Their authors, therefore,
were apt to relate only the good deeds of the persons about
whom they wrote, and these were often much exaggerated for the sake
of effect. The people of the time generally were superstitious and easily
appealed to by strange stories and the recital of marvelous events.
They were not critical, and even such of them as were able to read at
all could be made to believe almost anything that the writers of books
cared to say. And since these writers themselves shared in the superstition
and credulousness of the age, naturally such biographies as were
written abounded in tales which anybody to-day would know at a
glance could not be true. To all this Einhard's <i>Life of Charles the Great</i>
stands as a notable exception. It has its inaccuracies, but it still
deserves to be ranked almost in a class of its own as a trustworthy
biographical contribution to our knowledge of the earlier Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Einhard (or Eginhard) was a Frank, born about 770 near the Odenwald
in Franconia. After being educated at the monastery of Fulda he
was presented at the Frankish court, some time between 791 and 796,
where he remained twenty years as secretary and companion of the
king, and later emperor, Charlemagne. He was made what practically
corresponds to a modern minister of public works and in that capacity
is thought to have supervised the building of the palace and basilica
of the temple at Aachen, the palace of Ingelheim, the bridge over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Rhine at Mainz, and many other notable constructions of the king,
though regarding the precise work of this sort which he did there is a
general lack of definite proof. Despite the fact that he was a layman,
he was given charge of a number of abbeys. His last years were spent
at the Benedictine monastery of Seligenstadt, where he died about 840.
There is a legend that Einhard's wife, Emma, was a daughter of Charlemagne,
but this is to be regarded as merely a twelfth-century invention.</p>

<p>The <i>Vita Caroli Magni</i> was written as an expression of the author's
gratitude to his royal friend and patron, though it did not appear
until shortly after the latter's death in 814. "It contains the history
of a very great and distinguished man," says Einhard in his preface,
"but there is nothing in it to wonder at, besides his deeds, except the
fact that I, who am a barbarian, and very little versed in the Roman
language, seem to suppose myself capable of writing gracefully and
respectably in Latin." It is considered ordinarily that Einhard endeavored
to imitate the style of the Roman Suetonius, the biographer
of the first twelve Cæsars, though in reality his writing is perhaps
superior to that of Suetonius and there are scholars who hold that
if he really followed a classical model at all that model was Julius
Cæsar. Aside from the matter of literary style, there can be no reasonable
doubt that the idea of writing a biography of his master was suggested
to Einhard by the biographies of Suetonius, particularly that
of the Emperor Augustus. Despite his limitations, says Mr. Hodgkin,
the fact remains that "almost all our real, vivifying knowledge of
Charles the Great is derived from Einhard, and that the <i>Vita Caroli</i>
is one of the most precious literary bequests of the early Middle Ages."<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Certainly few mediæval writers had so good an opportunity as did
Einhard to know the truth about the persons and events they undertook
to describe.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> Charles was large and strong, and of lofty stature, though
not excessively tall. The upper part of his head was round, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
eyes very large and animated, nose a little long, hair auburn, and
face laughing and merry. His appearance was always stately
and dignified, whether he was standing or sitting, although his
neck was thick and somewhat short and his abdomen rather
prominent. The symmetry of the rest of his body concealed
these defects. His gait was firm, his whole carriage manly, and
<span class="sidebar">Personal
appearance</span>
his voice clear, but not so strong as his size led
one to expect. His health was excellent, except
during the four years preceding his death, when he was subject
to frequent fevers; toward the end of his life he limped a little
with one foot. Even in his later years he lived rather according
to his own inclinations than the advice of physicians; the latter
indeed he very much disliked, because they wanted him to give
up roasts, to which he was accustomed, and to eat boiled meat
instead. In accordance with the national custom, he took frequent
exercise on horseback and in the chase, in which sports
scarcely any people in the world can equal the Franks. He enjoyed
the vapors from natural warm springs, and often indulged
in swimming, in which he was so skilful that none could surpass
him; and hence it was that he built his palace at Aix-la-Chapelle,
and lived there constantly during his later years....<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p><b>23.</b> His custom was to wear the national, that is to say, the
Frankish, dress&mdash;next his skin a linen shirt and linen breeches,
and above these a tunic fringed with silk; while hose fastened by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
bands covered his lower limbs, and shoes his feet. In winter he
protected his shoulders and chest by a close-fitting coat of otter
or marten skins. Over all he flung a blue cloak, and he always
had a sword girt about him, usually one with a gold or silver hilt
and belt. He sometimes carried a jeweled sword, but only on
<span class="sidebar">Manner
of dress</span>
great feast-days or at the reception of ambassadors
from foreign nations. He despised foreign
costumes, however handsome, and never allowed himself to be
robed in them, except twice in Rome, when he donned the Roman
tunic, chlamys,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and shoes; the first time at the request of Pope
Hadrian,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> the second to gratify Leo, Hadrian's successor.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> On
great feast-days he made use of embroidered clothes, and shoes
adorned with precious stones; his cloak was fastened with a
golden buckle, and he appeared crowned with a diadem of gold
and gems; but on other days his dress differed little from that of
ordinary people.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Charles was temperate in eating, and especially so in
drinking, for he abhorred drunkenness in anybody, much more
in himself and those of his household; but he could not easily
abstain from food, and often complained that fasts injured his
health. He gave entertainments but rarely, only on great feast-days,
and then to large numbers of people. His meals consisted
ordinarily of four courses, not counting the roast, which his huntsmen
were accustomed to bring in on the spit; he was more fond
of this than of any other dish. While at table, he listened to
reading or music. The subjects of the readings were the stories
and deeds of olden time. He was fond, too, of St. Augustine's
books, and especially of the one entitled <i>The City of God</i>.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
He was so moderate in the use of wine and all sorts of drink that
he rarely allowed himself more than three cups in the course of a
<span class="sidebar">Every-day
life</span>
meal. In summer, after the midday meal, he
would eat some fruit, drain a single cup, put off
his clothes and shoes, just as he did for the night, and rest for two
or three hours. While he was dressing and putting on his shoes,
he not only gave audience to his friends, but if the Count of the
Palace<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> told him of any suit in which his judgment was necessary,
he had the parties brought before him forthwith, heard the
case, and gave his decision, just as if he were sitting in the judgment-seat.
This was not the only business that he transacted at
this time, but he performed any duty of the day whatever,
whether he had to attend to the matter himself, or to give
commands concerning it to his officers.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> Charles had the gift of ready and fluent speech, and could
express whatever he had to say with the utmost clearness. He
was not satisfied with ability to use his native language merely,
but gave attention to the study of foreign ones, and in particular
was such a master of Latin that he could speak it as well as his
native tongue; but he could understand Greek better than he
could speak it. He was so eloquent, indeed, that he might have
been taken for a teacher of oratory. He most zealously cherished
the liberal arts, held those who taught them in great esteem, and
conferred great honors upon them. He took lessons in grammar
of the deacon Peter of Pisa, at that time an aged man.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
deacon, Albin of Britain, surnamed Alcuin, a man of Saxon birth,
who was the greatest scholar of the day, was his teacher in other
<span class="sidebar">Education
and accomplishments</span>
branches of learning.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The king spent much
time and labor with him studying rhetoric, dialectic,
and especially astronomy. He learned to
make calculations, and used to investigate with much curiosity
and intelligence the motions of the heavenly bodies. He also
tried to write, and used to keep tablets and blanks in bed under
his pillow, that at leisure hours he might accustom his hand to
form the letters; however, as he began his efforts late in life, and
not at the proper time, they met with little success.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> He cherished with the greatest fervor and devotion the
principles of the Christian religion, which had been instilled into
him from infancy. Hence it was that he built the beautiful
basilica at Aix-la-Chapelle, which he adorned with gold and silver
and lamps, and with rails and doors of solid brass. He had the
columns and marbles for this structure brought from Rome and
Ravenna, for he could not find such as were suitable elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
He was a constant worshipper at this church as long as his health
permitted, going morning and evening, even after nightfall,
<span class="sidebar">Interest in religion
and the
Church</span>
besides attending mass. He took care that all
the services there conducted should be held in
the best possible manner, very often warning
the sextons not to let any improper or unclean thing be brought
into the building, or remain in it. He provided it with a number
of sacred vessels of gold and silver, and with such a quantity
of clerical robes that not even the door-keepers, who filled the
humblest office in the church, were obliged to wear their everyday
clothes when in the performance of their duties. He took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
great pains to improve the church reading and singing, for he
was well skilled in both, although he neither read in public nor
sang, except in a low tone and with others.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> He was very active in aiding the poor, and in that open
generosity which the Greeks call alms; so much so, indeed, that
he not only made a point of giving in his own country and his
own kingdom, but when he discovered that there were Christians
living in poverty in Syria, Egypt, and Africa, at Jerusalem,
Alexandria, and Carthage, he had compassion on their wants,
and used to send money over the seas to them. The reason that
he earnestly strove to make friends with the kings beyond seas
was that he might get help and relief to the Christians living
<span class="sidebar">Generosity
and charities</span>

under their rule. He cared for the Church Of St.
Peter the Apostle at Rome above all other holy
and sacred places, and heaped high its treasury with a vast wealth
of gold, silver, and precious stones. He sent great and countless
gifts to the popes;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and throughout his whole reign the wish that
he had nearest his heart was to re-establish the ancient authority
of the city of Rome under his care and by his influence, and to
defend and protect the Church of St. Peter, and to beautify and
enrich it out of his own store above all other churches. Nevertheless,
although he held it in such veneration, only four times<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> did
he repair to Rome to pay his vows and make his supplications
during the whole forty-seven years that he reigned.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<h4>16. The War with the Saxons (772-803)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>When Charlemagne became sole ruler of the Franks, in 771, he
found his kingdom pretty well hemmed in by a belt of kindred,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
though more or less hostile, Germanic peoples. The most important
of these were the Visigoths in northern Spain, the Lombards in the
Po Valley, the Bavarians in the region of the upper Danube, and the
Saxons between the Rhine and the Elbe. The policy of the new king,
perhaps only dimly outlined at the beginning of the reign but growing
ever more definite as time went on, was to bring all of these neighboring
peoples under the Frankish dominion, and so to build up a great
state which should include the whole Germanic race of western and
northern continental Europe. Most of the king's time during the first
thirty years, or two-thirds, of the reign was devoted to this stupendous
task. The first great step was taken in the conquest of the Lombards in
774, after which Charlemagne assumed the title of King of the Lombards.
In 787 Bavaria was annexed to the Frankish kingdom, the
settlement in this case being in the nature of a complete absorption
rather than a mere personal union such as followed the Lombard conquest.
The next year an expedition across the Pyrenees resulted in the
annexation of the Spanish March&mdash;a region in which the Visigoths had
managed to maintain some degree of independence against the Saracens.
In all these directions little fighting was necessary and for one
reason or another the sovereignty of the Frankish king was recognized
without much delay or resistance.</p>

<p>The problem of reducing the Saxons was, however, a very different
one. The Saxons of Charlemagne's day were a people of purest Germanic
stock dwelling in the land along the Rhine, Ems, Weser, and
Elbe, and inland as far as the low mountains of Hesse and Thuringia&mdash;the
regions which now bear the names of Hanover, Brunswick, Oldenburg,
and Westphalia. The Saxons, influenced as yet scarcely at all
by contact with the Romans, retained substantially the manner of
life described seven centuries earlier by Tacitus in the <i>Germania</i>. They
lived in small villages, had only the loosest sort of government, and
clung tenaciously to the warlike mythology of their ancestors. Before
Charlemagne's time they had engaged in frequent border wars with
the Franks and had shown capacity for making very obstinate resistance.
And when Charlemagne himself undertook to subdue them he entered
upon a task which kept him busy much of the time for over thirty years,
that is, from 772 to 803. In all not fewer than eighteen distinct campaigns
were made into the enemy's territory. The ordinary course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
of events was that Charlemagne would lead his army across the Rhine
in the spring, the Saxons would make some little resistance and then
disperse or withdraw toward the Baltic, and the Franks would leave
a garrison and return home for the winter. As soon as the enemy's
back was turned the Saxons would rally, expel or massacre the garrison,
and assert their complete independence of Frankish authority. The
next year the whole thing would have to be done over again. There
were not more than two great battles in the entire contest; the war
consisted rather of a monotonous series of "military parades," apparent
submissions, revolts, and re-submissions. As Professor Emerton puts
it, "From the year 772 to 803, a period of over thirty years, this war
was always on the programme of the Frankish policy, now resting for
a few years, and now breaking out with increased fury, until finally
the Saxon people, worn out with the long struggle against a superior
foe, gave it up and became a part of the Frankish Empire."<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>It is to be regretted that we have no Saxon account of the great
contest except the well-meant, but very inadequate, history by Widukind,
a monk of Corbie, written about the middle of the tenth century.
However, the following passage from Einhard, the secretary and
biographer of Charlemagne, doubtless describes with fair accuracy the
conditions and character of the struggle. A few of the writer's strongest
statements regarding Saxon perfidy should be accepted only with some
allowance for Frankish prejudice.</p>

<p>No war ever undertaken by the Frankish nation was carried
on with such persistence and bitterness, or cost so much labor,
because the Saxons, like almost all the tribes of Germany, were
a fierce people, given to the worship of devils and hostile to our
religion, and did not consider it dishonorable to transgress and
violate all law, human and divine. Then there were peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
circumstances that tended to cause a breach of peace every day.
Except in a few places, where large forests or mountain-ridges
<span class="sidebar">Lack of a natural
frontier</span>
intervened and made the boundaries certain, the
line between ourselves and the Saxons passed
almost in its whole extent through an open country, so that
there was no end to the murders, thefts, and arsons on both sides.
In this way the Franks became so embittered that they at last
resolved to make reprisals no longer, but to come to open war
with the Saxons.</p>

<p>Accordingly, war was begun against them, and was waged for
thirty-three successive years<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> with great fury; more, however,
to the disadvantage of the Saxons than of the Franks. It could
doubtless have been brought to an end sooner, had it not been
for the faithlessness of the Saxons. It is hard to say how often
they were conquered, and, humbly submitting to the king,
<span class="sidebar">Faithlessness
of the Saxons</span>
promised to do what was enjoined upon them,
gave without hesitation the required hostages,
and received the officers sent them from the king. They were
sometimes so much weakened and reduced that they promised
to renounce the worship of devils and to adopt Christianity; but
they were no less ready to violate these terms than prompt to
accept them, so that it is impossible to tell which came easier to
them to do; scarcely a year passed from the beginning of the war
without such changes on their part. But the king did not suffer
his high purpose and steadfastness&mdash;firm alike in good and evil
fortune&mdash;to be wearied by any fickleness on their part, or to be
turned from the task that he had undertaken; on the contrary,
<span class="sidebar">Charlemagne's
settlement of
Saxons in Gaul
and Germany</span>
he never allowed their faithless behavior to go unpunished,
but either took the field against them
in person, or sent his counts with an army to wreak
vengeance and exact righteous satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> At last, after conquering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
and subduing all who had offered resistance, he took
ten thousand of those who lived on the banks of the Elbe, and
settled them, with their wives and children, in many different
bodies here and there in Gaul and Germany. The war that had
lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to
<span class="sidebar">The terms of peace</span>
the terms offered by the king; which were renunciation
of their national religious customs and
the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian
religion,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and union with the Franks to form one people.</p>

<h4>17. The Capitulary Concerning the Saxon Territory (cir. 780)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Just as the Saxons were the most formidable of Charlemagne's
foes to meet and defeat in open battle, so were they the most difficult
to maintain in anything like orderly allegiance after they had been
tentatively conquered. This was true in part because of their untamed,
freedom-loving character, but also in no small measure because
of the thoroughgoing revolution which the Frankish king sought to
work in their conditions of life, and especially in their religion. Before
the Saxon war was far advanced it had very clearly assumed the character
of a crusade of the Christian Franks against the "pagans of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
north." And when the Saxon had been brought to give sullen promise
of submission, it was his dearest possession&mdash;his fierce, heroic mythology&mdash;that
was first to be swept away. By the stern decree of the conqueror
Woden and Thor and Freya must go. In their stead was to be set up
the Christian religion with its churches, its priests, its fastings, its ceremonial
observances. Death was to be the penalty for eating meat during
Lent, if done "out of contempt for Christianity," and death also for
"causing the body of a dead man to be burned in accordance with
pagan rites." Even for merely scorning "to come to baptism," or
"wishing to remain a pagan," a man was to forfeit his life. The selections
which follow are taken from the capitulary <i>De Partibus Saxoniæ</i>,
which was issued by Charlemagne probably at the Frankish assembly
held at Paderborn in 780. If this date is correct (and it cannot be far
wrong) the regulations embodied in the capitulary were established
for the Saxon territories when there perhaps seemed to be a good
prospect of peace but when, as later events showed, there yet remained
twenty-three years of war before the final subjugation. From the
beginning of the struggle the Church had been busy setting up new
centers of influence&mdash;some abbeys and especially the great bishoprics
of Bremen, Minden, Paderborn, Verden, Osnabrück, and Halberstadt&mdash;among
the Saxon pagans, and the primary object of Charlemagne in
this capitulary was to give to these ecclesiastical foundations the
task of civilizing the country and to protect them, together with his
counts or governing agents, while they should be engaged in this work.
The severity of the Saxon war was responsible for the unusually
stringent character of this body of regulations. In 797, at a great
assembly at Aix-la-Chapelle, another capitulary for the Saxons was
issued, known as the <i>Capitulum Saxonicum</i>, and in this the harsh
features of the earlier capitulary were considerably relaxed. By 797
the resistance of the Saxons was pretty well broken, and it had become
Charlemagne's policy to give his conquered subjects a government
as nearly as possible like that the Franks themselves enjoyed. The
chief importance of Charlemagne's conquests toward the east lies in
the fact that by them broad stretches of German territory were brought
for the first time within the pale of civilization.</p>

<p>These capitularies, like the hundreds of others that were issued by the
various kings of the Franks, were edicts or decrees drawn up under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
king's direction, discussed and adopted in the assembly of the people,
and published in the local districts of the kingdom by the counts
and bishops. They were of a less permanent and fixed character
than the so-called "leges," or laws established by long usage and
custom.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to all that the churches of Christ, which are now
being built in Saxony and consecrated to God, should not have
less, but greater and more illustrious honor than the shrines of
the idols have had.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> If any one shall have fled to a church for refuge, let no one
presume to expel him from the church by violence, but he shall
<span class="sidebar">The churches
as a place of
refuge</span>
be left in peace until he shall be brought to the
judicial assemblage; and on account of the honor
due to God and the saints, and the reverence due
to the church itself, let his life and all his members be granted to
him. Moreover, let him plead his cause as best he can and he
shall be judged; and so let him be led to the presence of the lord
king, and the latter shall send him where it shall seem fitting
to his clemency.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> If any one shall have entered a church by violence and
shall have carried off anything in it by force or theft, or
shall have burned the church itself, let him be punished by
death.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p><b>4.</b> If any one, out of contempt for Christianity, shall have
<span class="sidebar">Offenses
against the
Church</span>

despised the holy Lenten feast and shall have eaten
flesh, let him be punished by death. But, nevertheless,
let it be taken into consideration by a priest,
lest perchance any one from necessity has been led to eat flesh.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p><b>5.</b> If any one shall have killed a bishop or priest or deacon
let him likewise be punished capitally.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> If any one, deceived by the devil, shall have believed, after
the manner of the pagans, that any man or woman is a witch
and eats men, and on this account shall have burned the person,
or shall have given the person's flesh to others to eat, or shall
have eaten it himself, let him be punished by a capital sentence.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> If any one, in accordance with pagan rites, shall have
caused the body of a dead man to be burned, and shall have reduced
his bones to ashes, let him be punished capitally.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> If any one of the race of the Saxons hereafter, concealed
among them, shall have wished to hide himself unbaptized,
<span class="sidebar">Refusal to be
baptized</span>
and shall have scorned to come to baptism,
and shall have wished to remain a pagan, let
him be punished by death.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> If any one shall have sacrificed a man to the devil, and,
after the manner of the pagans, shall have presented him as a
victim to the demons, let him be punished by death.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> If any one shall have formed a conspiracy with the pagans
against the Christians, or shall have wished to join with them
<span class="sidebar">Conspiracy
against Christians</span>
in opposition to the Christians, let him be punished
by death; and whosoever shall have consented
fraudulently to this same against the
king and the Christian people, let him be punished by death.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> If any one shall have shown himself unfaithful to the
lord king, let him be punished with a capital sentence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p><b>13.</b> If any one shall have killed his lord or lady, let him be
punished in a like manner.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> If, indeed, for these mortal crimes secretly committed
any one shall have fled of his own accord to a priest, and after
confession shall have wished to do penance, let him be freed by
the testimony of the priest from death....<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p><b>18.</b> On the Lord's day no meetings or public judicial assemblages
shall be held, unless perchance in a case of great necessity,
<span class="sidebar">Observance
of the Sabbath
and of festival

or when war compels it, but all shall go to
church to hear the word of God, and shall be free
for prayers or good works. Likewise, also, on the
special festivals they shall devote themselves to God and to the
services of the Church, and shall refrain from secular assemblies.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Likewise, it has been pleasing to insert in these decrees
that all infants shall be baptized within a year; and we have

infants</span>
decreed this, that if any one shall have refused
to bring his infant to baptism within the course
of a year, without the advice or permission of the priest, if he is

if a <i>litus</i>, 30.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p><b>20.</b> If any one shall have contracted a prohibited or illegal
marriage, if a noble, 60 <i>solidi</i>; if a freeman, 30; if a <i>litus</i>, 15.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> If any one shall have made a vow at springs or trees or
<span class="sidebar">Keeping up
heathen rites</span>
groves,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> or shall have made an offering after the
manner of the heathen and shall have partaken
of a repast in honor of the demons, if he shall be a noble, 60
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
<i>solidi</i>; if a freeman, 30; if a <i>litus</i>, 15. If, indeed, they have not
the means of paying at once, they shall be given into the service
of the Church until the <i>solidi</i> are paid.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> We command that the bodies of Saxon Christians shall be
carried to the church cemeteries, and not to the mounds of the
pagans.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> We have ordered that diviners and soothsayers shall be
handed over to the churches and priests.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Concerning robbers and malefactors who shall have fled
from one county to another, if any one shall receive them into
<span class="sidebar">Fugitive
criminals</span>
his protection and shall keep them with him for
seven nights,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> except for the purpose of bringing
them to justice, let him pay our ban.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Likewise, if a count<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> shall
have concealed them, and shall be unwilling to bring them forward
so that justice may be done, and is not able to excuse himself for
this, let him lose his office.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> No one shall presume to impede any man coming to us
to seek justice; and if anyone shall have attempted to do this,
he shall pay our ban.</p>

<p><b>34.</b> We have forbidden that Saxons shall hold public assemblies
in general, unless perchance our <i>missus</i><a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> shall have caused
them to come together in accordance with our

<h4>18. The Capitulary Concerning the Royal Domains (cir. 800)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The revenues which came into Charlemagne's treasury were derived
chiefly from his royal domains. There was no system of general taxation,
such as modern nations maintain, and the funds realized from
gifts, fines, rents, booty, and tribute money, were quite insufficient to
meet the needs of the court, modest though they were. Charlemagne's
interest in his villas, or private farms, was due therefore not less to his
financial dependence upon them than to his personal liking for thrifty
agriculture and thoroughgoing administration. The royal domains of
the Frankish kingdom, already extensive at Charlemagne's accession,
were considerably increased during his reign. It has been well said
that Charlemagne was doubtless the greatest landed proprietor of the
realm and that he "supervised the administration of these lands as a
sovereign who knows that his power rests partly on his riches."<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> He
gave the closest personal attention to his estates and was always watchful
lest he be defrauded out of even the smallest portion of their products
which was due him. The capitulary <i>De Villis</i>, from which the
following passages have been selected, is a lengthy document in which
Charlemagne sought to prescribe clearly and minutely the manifold
duties of the stewards in charge of these estates. We may regard it,
however, as in the nature of an ideal catalogue of what the king would
like to have on his domains rather than as a definite statement of
what was always actually to be found there. From it may be gleaned
many interesting facts regarding rural life in western Europe during
the eighth and ninth centuries. Its date is uncertain, but it was about
800&mdash;possibly somewhat earlier.</p>

<h4>19. An Inventory of One of Charlemagne's Estates</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In the following inventory we have a specimen of the annual statements
required by Charlemagne from the stewards on his royal domains.
The location of Asnapium is unknown, but it is evident that
this estate was one of the smaller sort. Like all the rest, it was liable

detailed character of the inventory is worthy of note, as is also the
number of industries which must have been engaged in by the inhabitants
of the estate and its dependent villas.</p>

<h4>20. Charlemagne Crowned Emperor (800)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The occasion of Charlemagne's presence in Rome in 800 was a conflict
between Pope Leo III. and a faction of the populace led by two
nephews of the preceding pope, Hadrian I. It seems that in 799 Leo
had been practically driven out of the papal capital and imprisoned
in a neighboring monastery, but that through the planning of a subordinate
official he had soon contrived to escape. At any rate he got
out of Italy as speedily as he could and made his way across the Alps
to seek aid at the court of Charlemagne. The Frankish king was still
busy with the Saxon war and did not allow the prospect of a papal
visit to interfere with his intended campaign; but at Paderborn, in
the very heart of the Saxon country, where he could personally direct
the operations of his troops, he established his headquarters and awaited
the coming of the refugee pope. The meeting of the two dignitaries
resulted in a pledge of the king once more to take up the burden of
defending the Roman Church and the Vicar of Christ, this time not
against outside foes but against internal disturbers. After about a
year Charlemagne repaired to Rome and called upon the Pope and his
adversaries to appear before him for judgment. When the leaders
of the hostile faction refused to comply, they were summarily condemned
to death, though it is said that through the generous advice
of Leo they were afterwards released on a sentence of exile. During
the ceremonies which followed in celebration of Christmas occurred
the famous coronation which is described in the two passages given
below.</p>

<p>Although the coronation has been regarded as so important as to
have been called "the central event of the Middle Ages,"<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> it is by no
means an easy task to determine precisely what significance it was
thought to have at the time. We can look back upon it now and see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
that it marked the beginning of the so-called "Holy Roman Empire"&mdash;a
creation that endured in <i>fact</i> only a very short time but whose name
and theory survived all the way down to Napoleon's reorganization of
the German states in 1806. One view of the matter is that Charlemagne's
coronation meant that a Frankish king had become the successor
of Emperor Constantine VI., just deposed at Constantinople,
and that therefore the universal Roman Empire was again to be ruled
from a western capital as it had been before the time of the first Constantine.
It will be observed that extract (a), taken from the Annals
of Lauresheim, and therefore of German origin, at least suggests this
explanation. But, whether or not precisely this idea was in the mind
of those who took part in the ceremony, in actual fact no such transfer
of universal sovereignty from Constantinople to the Frankish capital
ever took place. The Eastern Empire lived right on under its own
line of rulers and, so far as we know, aside from some rather vague
negotiations for a marriage of Charlemagne and the Empress Irene,
the new western Emperor seems never to have contemplated the extension
of his authority over the East. His great aspiration had been
to consolidate all the Germanic peoples of western continental Europe
under the leadership of the Franks; that, by 800, he had practically done;
he had no desire to go farther. His dominion was always limited strictly
to the West, and at the most he can be regarded after 800 as not more
than the reviver of the old western half of the Empire, and hence as
the successor of Romulus Augustulus. But even this view is perhaps
somewhat strained. The chroniclers of the time liked to set up fine
theories of the sort, and later it came to be to the interest of papal and
imperial rivals to make large use, in one way or another, of such theories.
But we to-day may look upon the coronation as nothing more
than a formal recognition of a condition of things already existing.
By his numerous conquests Charlemagne had drawn under his control
such a number of peoples and countries that his position had come to
be that which we think of as an emperor's rather than that of simple
king of the Franks. The Pope did not give Charlemagne his empire;
the energetic king had built it for himself. At the most, what Leo did
was simply to bestow a title already earned and to give with it presumably
the blessing and favor of the Church, whose devoted servant
Charlemagne repeatedly professed to be. That the idea of imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
unity still survived in the West is certain, and without doubt many
men looked upon the ceremony of 800 as re-establishing such unity;
but as events worked out it was not so much Charlemagne's empire
as the papacy itself that was the real continuation of the power of the
Cæsars. Conditions had so changed that it was impossible in the
nature of things for Charlemagne to be a Roman emperor in the old
sense. The coronation gave him a new title and new prestige, but
no new subjects, no larger army, no more princely income. The basis
of his power continued to be, in every sense, his Frankish kingdom.
The structural element in the revived empire was Frankish; the Roman
was merely ornamental.</p>

<p>And because the name of emperor had now ceased among the
Greeks, and their empire was possessed by a woman,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> it seemed
both to Leo the pope himself, and to all the holy fathers who
were present in the self-same council,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> as well as to the rest of
the Christian people, that they ought to take to be emperor
Charles, king of the Franks, who held Rome herself, where the
Cæsars had always been wont to sit, and all the other regions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
which he ruled through Italy and Gaul and Germany; and inasmuch
as God had given all these lands into his hand, it seemed
right that with the help of God, and at the prayer of the whole
Christian people, he should have the name of emperor also.
[The Pope's] petition King Charles willed not to refuse,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> but submitting
himself with all humility to God, and at the prayer of
the priests, and of the whole Christian people, on the day of the
nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ, he took on himself the name
of emperor, being consecrated by the Pope Leo.... For
this also was done by the will of God ... that the heathen
might not mock the Christians if the name of emperor should
have ceased among them.</p>

crown. Then all the faithful Romans, beholding the choice of
such a friend and defender of the holy Roman Church, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
the pontiff, did by the will of God and of the blessed Peter, the
key-bearer of the heavenly kingdom, cry with a loud voice, "To
Charles, the most pious Augustus, crowned of God, the great and
peace-giving Emperor, be life and victory." While he, before
the altar of the church, was calling upon many of the saints, it
was proclaimed three times, and by the common voice of all he
was chosen to be emperor of the Romans. Then the most holy
high priest and pontiff anointed Charles with holy oil, and also
his most excellent son to be king,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> upon the very day of the birth

<h4>21. The General Capitulary for the Missi (802)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Throughout the larger part of Charlemagne's dominion the chief
local unit of administration was the county, presided over by the count.
The count was appointed by the Emperor, generally from among the
most important landed proprietors of the district. His duties included
the levy of troops, the publication of the royal decrees or capitularies,
the administration of justice, and the collection of revenues. On the
frontiers, where the need of defense was greatest, these local officers
exercised military functions of a special character and were commonly
known as "counts of the march," or dukes, or sometimes as margraves.
In order that these royal officials, in whatever part of the country,
might not abuse their authority as against their fellow-subjects, or
engage in plots against the unity of the empire, Charlemagne devised a
plan of sending out at stated intervals men who were known as <i>missi
dominici</i> ("the lord's messengers") to visit the various counties, hear
complaints of the people, inquire into the administration of the counts,
and report conditions to the Emperor. They were to serve as connecting
links between the central and local governments and as safeguards
against the ever powerful forces of disintegration. Such itinerant
royal agents had not been unknown in Merovingian times, and they
had probably been made use of pretty frequently by Charles Martel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
and Pepin the Short. But it was Charlemagne who reduced the employment
of <i>missi</i> to a system and made it a fixed part of the governmental
machinery of the Frankish kingdom. This he did mainly by
the <i>Capitulare Missorum Generale</i>, promulgated early in 802 at an
assembly at the favorite capital Aix-la-Chapelle. The whole empire
was divided into districts, or <i>missaticæ</i>, and each of these was to be
visited annually by two of the <i>missi</i>. A churchman and a layman
were usually sent out together, probably because they were to have
jurisdiction over both the clergy and the laity, and also that they
might restrain each other from injustice or other misconduct. They
were appointed by the Emperor, at first from his lower order of vassals,
but after a time from the leading bishops, abbots, and nobles of the
empire. They were given power to depose minor officials for misdemeanors,
and to summon higher ones before the Emperor. By 812,
at least, they were required to make four rounds of inspection each
year.</p>

<p>In the capitulary for the <i>missi</i> Charlemagne took occasion to include
a considerable number of regulations and instructions regarding the
general character of the local governments, the conduct of local officers,
the manner of life of the clergy, the management of the monasteries,
and other things of vital importance to the strength of the empire
and the well-being of the people. The capitulary may be regarded as
a broad outline of policy and conduct which its author, lately become
emperor, wished to see realized throughout his vast dominion.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Concerning the embassy sent out by the lord emperor.</p>

<p>Therefore, the most serene and most Christian lord emperor
Charles has chosen from his nobles the wisest and most prudent
<span class="sidebar">The missi
sent out</span>
men, both archbishops and some of the other
bishops also, and venerable abbots and pious
laymen, and has sent them throughout his whole kingdom, and
through them he would have all the various classes of persons
mentioned in the following chapters live in accordance with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
the correct law. Moreover, where anything which is not right
and just has been enacted in the law, he has ordered them to
inquire into this most diligently and to inform him of it. He
desires, God granting, to reform it. And let no one, through his
cleverness or craft, dare to oppose or thwart the written law, as
many are wont to do, or the judicial sentence passed upon him,
or to do injury to the churches of God, or the poor, or the widows,
or the wards, or any Christian. But all shall live entirely in
accordance with God's precept, honestly and under a just rule,
and each one shall be admonished to live in harmony with his
fellows in his business or profession; the canonical clergy<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> ought
to observe in every respect a canonical life without heeding base
gain; nuns ought to keep diligent watch over their lives; laymen
and the secular clergy<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> ought rightly to observe their laws without
malicious fraud; and all ought to live in mutual charity and
perfect peace.</p>

<p>And let the <i>missi</i> themselves make a diligent investigation
whenever any man claims that an injustice has been done him
by any one, just as they desire to deserve the grace of omnipotent
God and to keep their fidelity promised to Him, so that in all
cases, in accordance with the will and fear of God, they shall
administer the law fully and justly in the case of the holy churches
of God and of the poor, of wards and widows, and of the whole
people. And if there be anything of such a nature that they,
<span class="sidebar">The duties
of the missi</span>
together with the provincial counts, are not able
of themselves to correct it and to do justice
concerning it, they shall, without any reservation, refer it, together
with their reports, to the judgment of the emperor; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the straight path of justice shall not be impeded by any one on
account of flattery or gifts, or on account of any relationship,
or from fear of the powerful.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p><b>2.</b> Concerning the fidelity to be promised to the lord emperor.</p>

<p>He has commanded that every man in his whole kingdom,
whether ecclesiastic or layman, and each one according to his
<span class="sidebar">Oath to
be taken to
Charlemagne
as emperor</span>
vow and occupation, should now promise to him
as emperor the fidelity which he had previously
promised to him as king; and all of those who had
not yet made that promise should do likewise, down to those
who were twelve years old. And that it shall be announced to
all in public, so that each one might know, how great and how
many things are comprehended in that oath; not merely, as many
have thought hitherto, fidelity to the lord emperor as regards his
life, and not introducing any enemy into his kingdom out of
enmity, and not consenting to or concealing another's faithlessness
to him; but that all may know that this oath contains in
itself the following meaning:</p>

<p><b><a name="c3" id="c3"></a>3.</b> First, that each one voluntarily shall strive, in accordance
with his knowledge and ability, to live completely in the holy
<span class="sidebar">What the
new oath
was to mean</span>
service of God, in accordance with the precept
of God and in accordance with his own promise,
because the lord emperor is unable to give to
all individually the necessary care and discipline.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Secondly, that no man, either through perjury or any
other wile or fraud, or on account of the flattery or gift of any
one, shall refuse to give back or dare to take possession of or
conceal a serf of the lord emperor, or a district, or land, or anything
that belongs to him; and that no one shall presume, through
perjury or other wile, to conceal or entice away his fugitive fiscaline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
serfs<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> who unjustly and fraudulently say that they are
free.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> That no one shall presume to rob or do any injury fraudulently
to the churches of God, or widows, or orphans, or pilgrims;<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
for the lord emperor himself, under God and His saints, has constituted
himself their protector and defender.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> That no one shall dare to lay waste a benefice<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> of the lord
emperor, or to make it his own property.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> That no one shall presume to neglect a summons to war
from the lord emperor; and that no one of the counts shall be so
presumptuous as to dare to excuse any one of those who owe
military service, either on account of relationship, or flattery, or
gifts from any one.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> That no one shall presume to impede at all in any way
a ban<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> or command of the lord emperor, or to tamper with his
work, or to impede, or to lessen, or in any way to act contrary
to his will or commands. And that no one shall dare to neglect
to pay his dues or tax.</p>

<p><b><a name="c9" id="c9"></a>9.</b> That no one, for any reason, shall make a practice in court
of defending another unjustly, either from any desire of gain
when the cause is weak, or by impeding a just judgment by his
skill in reasoning, or by a desire of oppressing when the cause is
<span class="sidebar">Justice to
be rendered
in the courts</span>
weak. But each one shall answer for his own
cause or tax or debt, unless any one is infirm or
ignorant of pleading;<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> for these the <i>missi</i>, or the
chiefs who are in the court, or the judge who knows the case in
question, shall plead before the court; or, if it is necessary, such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
a person may be allowed as is acceptable to all and knows the
case well; but this shall be done wholly according to the convenience
of the chiefs or <i>missi</i> who are present. But in every
case it shall be done in accordance with justice and the law; and
no one shall have the power to impede justice by a gift, reward,
or any kind of evil flattery, or from any hindrance of relationship.
And no one shall unjustly consent to another in anything, but
with all zeal and good-will all shall be prepared to carry out
justice.</p>

<p>For all the above mentioned ought to be observed by the imperial
oath.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p><b>10.</b> [We ordain] that bishops and priests shall live according
to the canons<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and shall teach others to do the same.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> That bishops, abbots, and abbesses who are in charge of
others, with the greatest veneration shall strive to surpass their
<span class="sidebar">Obligations
of the clergy</span>
subjects in this diligence and shall not oppress
their subjects with a harsh rule or tyranny, but
with a sincere love shall carefully guard the flock committed to
them with mercy and charity, or by the examples of good works.</p>

<p><b><a name="c14" id="c14"></a>14.</b> That bishops, abbots and abbesses, and counts shall be
mutually in accord, following the law in order to render a just
judgment with all charity and unity of peace, and that they shall
live faithfully in accordance with the will of God, so that always
everywhere through them and among them a just judgment
shall be rendered. The poor, widows, orphans, and pilgrims
shall have consolation and defense from them; so that we,
through the good-will of these, may deserve the reward of eternal
life rather than punishment.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> That no bishops, abbots, priests, deacons, or other members
of the clergy shall presume to have dogs for hunting, or
hawks, falcons, and sparrow-hawks, but each shall observe fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the canons or rule of his order.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> If any one shall presume to do
so, let him know that he shall lose his office. And in addition he
shall suffer such punishment for his misconduct that the others
will be afraid to possess such things for themselves.</p>

<p><b><a name="c27" id="c27"></a>27.</b> And we command that no one in our whole kingdom shall
dare to deny hospitality to rich, or poor, or pilgrims; that is, let
no one deny shelter and fire and water to pilgrims traversing
our country in God's name, or to any one traveling for the love

<h4>22. A Letter of Charlemagne to Abbot Fulrad</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In Charlemagne's governmental and military system the clergy,
both regular and secular, had a place of large importance. From early
Frankish times the bishoprics and monasteries had been acquiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
large landed estates on which they enjoyed peculiar political and
judicial privileges. These lands came to the church authorities partly
by purchase, largely by gift, and not infrequently through concessions
by small land-holders who wished to get the Church's favor and protection
without actually moving off the little farms they had been
accustomed to cultivate. However acquired, the lands were administered
by the clergy with larger independence than was apt to be allowed
the average lay owner. Still, they were as much a part of the
empire as before and the powerful bishops and abbots were expected to
see that certain services were forthcoming when the Emperor found himself
in need of them. Among these was the duty of leading, or sending,
a quota of troops under arms to the yearly assembly. In the selection
below we have a letter written by Charlemagne some time between
804 and 811 to Fulrad, abbot of St. Quentin (about sixty miles northeast
of Paris), respecting the fulfilment of this important obligation.
The closing sentence indicates very clearly the price exacted by the
Emperor in return for concessions of temporal authority to ecclesiastical
magnates.</p>

<p>In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Charles,
most serene, august, crowned of God, great pacific Emperor,
who, by God's mercy, is King of the Franks and Lombards, to
Abbot Fulrad.</p>

<p>Let it be known to you that we have determined to hold our
general assembly<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> this year in the eastern part of Saxony, on the
River Bode, at the place which is known as Strassfurt.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
we enjoin that you come to this meeting-place, with all your
men well armed and equipped, on the fifteenth day before the
Kalends of July, that is, seven days before the festival of St.
John the Baptist.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Come, therefore, so prepared with your men
to the aforesaid place that you may be able to go thence well
equipped in any direction in which our command shall direct;
that is, with arms and accoutrements also, and other provisions
for war in the way of food and clothing. Each
horseman will be expected to have a shield, a
lance, a sword, a dagger, a bow, and quivers with
arrows; and in your carts shall be implements of various kinds,
that is, axes, planes, augers, boards, spades, iron shovels, and
<span class="sidebar">The troops
to be brought:
their equipment</span>
other utensils which are necessary in an army. In the wagons
also should be supplies of food for three months, dating from the
time of the assembly, together with arms and clothing for six
months. And furthermore we command that you see to it that
you proceed peacefully to the aforesaid place, through whatever
part of our realm your journey shall be made; that is, that you
presume to take nothing except fodder, wood, and water. And
let the followers of each one of your vassals march along with the
carts and horsemen, and let the leader always be with them
until they reach the aforesaid place, so that the absence of a
lord may not give to his men an opportunity to do evil.</p>

<p>Send your gifts,<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> which you ought to present to us at our
assembly in the middle of the month of May, to the place where
<span class="sidebar">Gifts for
the Emperor</span>
we then shall be. If it happens that your journey
shall be such that on your march you are able
in person to present these gifts of yours to us, we shall be greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
pleased. Be careful to show no negligence in the future if you
care to have our favor.</p>

<h4>23. The Carolingian Revival of Learning</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>One of Charlemagne's chief claims to distinction is that his reign,
largely through his own influence, comprised the most important
period of the so-called Carolingian renaissance, or revival of learning.
From the times of the Frankish conquest of Gaul until about the middle
of the eighth century, education in western Europe, except in Ireland
and Britain, was at a very low ebb and literary production quite insignificant.
The old Roman intellectual activity had nearly ceased,
and two or three centuries of settled life had been required to bring
the Franks to the point of appreciating and encouraging art and letters.
Even by Charlemagne's time people generally were far from being
awake to the importance of education, though a few of the more far-sighted
leaders, and especially Charlemagne himself, had come to
lament the gross ignorance which everywhere prevailed and were
ready to adopt strong measures to overcome it. Charlemagne was
certainly no scholar, judged even by the standards of his own
time; but had he been the most learned man in the world his interest
in education could not have been greater. Before studying the selection
given below, it would be well to read what Einhard said about
his master's zeal for learning and the amount of progress he made
personally in getting an education [see <a href="#Page_112">pp. 112</a>&mdash;<a href="#Page_113">113</a>].</p>

<p>The most conspicuous of Charlemagne's educational measures was
his enlarging and strengthening of the Scola Palatina, or Palace School.
This was an institution which had existed in the reign of his father
Pepin, and probably even earlier. It consisted of a group of scholars
gathered at the Frankish court for the purpose of studying and writing
literature, educating the royal household, and stimulating learning
throughout the country. It formed what we to-day might call an
academy of sciences. Under Charlemagne's care it came to include
such men of distinction as Paul the Deacon, historian of the Lombards,
Paulinus of Aquileia, a theologian, Peter of Pisa, a grammarian, and
above all Alcuin, a skilled teacher and writer from the school of York
in England. Its history falls into three main periods: (1) from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
middle of the eighth century to the year 782&mdash;the period during which
it was dominated by Paul the Deacon and his Italian colleagues;
(2) from 782 to about 800, when its leading spirit was Alcuin; and
(3) from 800 to the years of its decadence in the later ninth century,
when Frankish rather than foreign names appear most prominently in
its annals.</p>

<p>It was Charlemagne's ideal that throughout his entire dominion
opportunity should be open to all to obtain at least an elementary
education and to carry their studies as much farther as they liked.
To this end a regular system of schools was planned, beginning with
the village school, in charge of the parish priest for the most elementary
studies, and leading up through monastic and cathedral schools to
the School of the Palace. In the intermediate stages, corresponding
to our high schools and academies to-day, the subjects studied were
essentially the same as those which received attention in the Scola
Palatina. They were divided into two groups: (1) the <i>trivium</i>, including
grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic (or philosophy), and (2) the
<i>quadrivium</i>, including geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and music.
The system thus planned was never fully put in operation throughout
Frankland, for after Charlemagne's death the work which he had so
well begun was seriously interfered with by the falling off in intellectual
aggressiveness of the sovereigns, by civil war, and by the ravages of
the Hungarian and Norse invaders [see <a href="#Page_163">p. 163</a>]. A capitulary of
Louis the Pious in 817, for example, forbade the continuance of secular
education in monastic schools. Still, much of what had been
done remained, and never thereafter did learning among the Frankish
people fall to quite so low a stage as it had passed through in the sixth
and seventh centuries.</p>

<p>Charlemagne's interest in education may be studied best of all in
his capitularies. In the extract below we have the so-called letter
<i>De Litteris Colendis</i>, written some time between 780 and 800, which,
though addressed personally to Abbot Baugulf, of the monastery of
Fulda, was in reality a capitulary establishing certain regulations
regarding education in connection with the work of the monks. To
the Church was intrusted the task of raising the level of intelligence
among the masses, and the clergy were admonished to bring together
the children of both freemen and serfs in schools in which they might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
be trained, even as the sons of the nobles were trained at the royal
court.</p>

congregation&mdash;also to the faithful placed under your care&mdash;we
have sent loving greetings by our ambassadors in the name
of all-powerful God.</p>

<p>Be it known, therefore, to you, devoted and acceptable to
God, that we, together with our faithful, have deemed it expedient
<span class="sidebar">Men of the
Church charged
with the work
of education</span>
that the bishoprics and monasteries intrusted
by the favor of Christ to our control, in
addition to the order of monastic life and the
relationships of holy religion, should be zealous also in the cherishing
of letters, and in teaching those who by the gift of God are
able to learn, according as each has capacity. So that, just as
the observance of the rule<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> adds order and grace to the integrity
of morals, so also zeal in teaching and learning may do the same
for sentences, to the end that those who wish to please God by
living rightly should not fail to please Him also by speaking correctly.
For it is written, "Either from thy words thou shall be
justified or from thy words thou shalt be condemned" [Matt., xii.
37]. Although right conduct may be better than knowledge,
nevertheless knowledge goes before conduct. Therefore each one
ought to study what he desires to accomplish, in order that so
much the more fully the mind may know what ought to be done.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
as the tongue speeds in the praises of all-powerful God without
the hindrances of mistakes. For while errors should be shunned
<span class="sidebar">Even the clergy
often unable
to speak and
write correctly</span>
by all men, so much the more ought they to be
avoided, as far as possible, by those who are
chosen for this very purpose alone.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> They ought
to be the specially devoted servants of truth. For often in
recent years when letters have been written to us from monasteries,
in which it was stated that the brethren who dwelt
there offered up in our behalf sacred and pious prayers, we
have recognized, in most cases, both correct thoughts and
uncouth expressions; because what pious devotion dictated
faithfully to the mind, the tongue, uneducated on account of
the neglect of study, was not able to express in the letter without
error. Whence it happened that we began to fear lest perchance,
as the skill in writing was less, so also the wisdom for understanding
the Holy Scriptures might be much less than it rightly ought
to be. And we all know well that, although errors of speech are
dangerous, far more dangerous are errors of the understanding.</p>

<p>Therefore, we exhort you not only not to neglect the study of
letters, but also with most humble mind, pleasing to God, to
<span class="sidebar">Education essential
to an
understanding
of the Scriptures</span>
study earnestly in order that you may be able
more easily and more correctly to penetrate the
mysteries of the divine Scriptures. Since, moreover,
images [similes], tropes<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and like figures
are found in the sacred pages, nobody doubts that each one in
reading these will understand the spiritual sense more quickly
if previously he shall have been fully instructed in the mastery
of letters. Such men truly are to be chosen for this work as have
both the will and the ability to learn and a desire to instruct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
others. And may this be done with a zeal as great as the earnestness
with which we command it. For we desire you to be, as
the soldiers of the Church ought to be, devout in mind, learned
in discourse, chaste in conduct, and eloquent in speech, so that
when any one shall seek to see you, whether out of reverence for
God or on account of your reputation for holy conduct, just as
he is edified by your appearance, he may also be instructed by
the wisdom which he has learned from your reading or singing,
and may go away gladly, giving thanks to Almighty God.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.<br />
THE ERA OF THE LATER CAROLINGIANS</h3>

<h4>24. The Oaths of Strassburg (842)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The broad empire of Germanic peoples built up by Charlemagne was
extremely difficult to hold together. Even before the death of its
masterful creator, in 814, it was already showing signs of breaking up,
and after that event the process of dissolution set in rapidly. It will
not do to look upon this falling to pieces as caused entirely by the
weakness of Charlemagne's successors. The trouble lay deeper, in the
natural love of independence common to all the Germans, in the wide
differences that had come to exist among Saxons, Lombards, Bavarians,
Franks, and other peoples in the empire, and finally in the prevailing
ill-advised principle of royal succession by which the territories making
up the empire, like those composing the old Frankish kingdom, were
regarded as personal property to be divided among the sovereign's
sons, just as was the practice respecting private possessions. As a
consequence of these things the generation following the death of
Charlemagne was a period of much confusion in western Europe. The
trouble first reached an acute stage in 817 when Emperor Louis the
Pious, Charlemagne's son and successor, was constrained to make a
division of the empire among his three sons, Lothair, Pepin, and Louis.
The Emperor expressly stipulated that despite this arrangement there
was to be still "one sole empire, and not three"; but it is obvious that
the imperial unity was at least pretty seriously threatened, and when,
in 823, Louis's second wife, Judith of Bavaria, gave birth to a son and
immediately set up in his behalf an urgent demand for a share of the
empire, civil war among the rival claimants could not be averted. In the
struggle that followed the distracted Emperor completely lost his throne
for a time (833). Thereafter he was ready to accept almost any arrangement
that would enable him to live out his remaining days in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
peace. When he died, in 840, two of the sons, Louis the German and
Judith's child, who came to be known as Charles the Bald, combined
against their brother Lothair (Pepin had died in 838) with the purpose
of wresting from him the imperial crown, which the father, shortly
before his death, had bestowed upon him. At least they were determined
that this mark of favor from the father should not give the
older brother any superiority over them. In the summer of 841 the
issue was put to the test in a great battle at Fontenay, a little distance
east of Orleans, with the result that Lothair was badly defeated. In
February of the following year Louis and Charles, knowing that Lothair
was still far from regarding himself as conquered, bound themselves
by oath at Strassburg, in the valley of the Rhine, to keep up their
joint opposition until they should be entirely successful.</p>

<p>The pledges exchanged on this occasion are as interesting to the
student of language as to the historian. The army which accompanied
Louis was composed of men of almost pure Germanic blood and speech,
while that with Charles was made up of men from what is now southern
and western France, where the people represented a mixture of Frankish
and old Roman and Gallic stocks. As a consequence Louis took
the oath in the <i>lingua romana</i> for the benefit of Charles's soldiers, and
Charles reciprocated by taking it in the <i>lingua teudisca</i>, in order that
the Germans might understand it. Then the followers of the two
kings took oath, each in his own language, that if their own king should
violate his agreement they would not support him in acts of hostility
against the other brother, provided the latter had been true to his word.
The <i>lingua romana</i> employed marks a stage in the development of the
so-called Romance languages of to-day&mdash;French, Spanish, and Italian&mdash;just
as the <i>lingua teudisca</i> approaches the character of modern Teutonic
languages&mdash;German, Dutch, and English. The oaths and the
accompanying address of the kings are the earliest examples we have
of the languages used by the common people of the early Middle Ages.
Latin was of course the language of literature, records, and correspondence,
matters with which ordinary people had little or nothing to
do. The necessity under which the two kings found themselves of
using two quite different modes of speech in order to be understood
by all the soldiers is evidence that already by the middle of the ninth
century the Romance and Germanic languages were becoming essentially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
distinct. It was prophetic, too, of the fast approaching cleavage
of the northern and southern peoples politically.</p>

<p>Nithardus, whose account of the exchange of oaths at Strassburg
is translated below, was an active participant in the events of the
first half of the ninth century. He was born about 790, his mother
being Charlemagne's daughter Bertha and his father the noted courtier
and poet Angilbert. In the later years of Charlemagne's reign, and
probably under Louis the Pious and Charles the Bald, he was in charge
of the defense of the northwest coasts against the Northmen. He
fought for Charles the Bald at Fontenay and was frequently employed
in those troublous years between 840 and 843 in the fruitless negotiations
among the rival sons of Louis. Neither the date nor the manner
of his death is known. There are traditions that he was killed
in 858 or 859 while fighting the Northmen; but other stories just as
well founded tell us that he became disgusted with the turmoil of the
world, retired to a monastery, and there died about 853. His history
of the wars of the sons of Louis the Pious (covering the period
840-843) was undertaken at the request of Charles the Bald. The
first three books were written in 842, the fourth in 843. Aside from
a rather too favorable attitude toward Charles, the work is very trustworthy,
and the claim is even made by some that among all of the
historians of the Carolingian period, not even Einhard excepted, no
one surpassed Nithardus in spirit, method, and insight. It may further
be noted that Nithardus was the first historical writer of any importance
in the Middle Ages who was not some sort of official in the Church.</p>

<p>Lothair was given to understand that Louis and Charles were
supporting each other with considerable armies.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Seeing that
his plans were crushed in every direction, he made a long but
profitless expedition and abandoned the country about Tours.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
At length he returned into France,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> worn out with fatigue, as
was also his army. Pepin,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> bitterly repenting that he had been
<span class="sidebar">Movements
of the hostile
parties in 841-842</span>
on Lothair's side, withdrew into Aquitaine.
Charles, learning that Otger, bishop of Mainz,
objected to the proposed passage of Louis by
way of Mainz to join his brother, set out by way of the city of
Toul<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and entered Alsace at Saverne. When Otger heard of
this, he and his supporters abandoned the river and sought
places where they might hide themselves as speedily as possible.
On the fifteenth of February Louis and Charles came together in
the city formerly called Argentoratum, now known as Strassburg,
and there they took the mutual oaths which are given herewith,
Louis in the <i>lingua romana</i> and Charles in the <i>lingua teudisca</i>.
Before the exchange of oaths they addressed the assembled people,
each in his own language, and Louis, being the elder, thus began:</p>

<p>"How often, since the death of our father, Lothair has pursued
my brother and myself and tried to destroy us, is known to you
all. So, then, when neither brotherly love, nor Christian feeling,
nor any reason whatever could bring about a peace between us
upon fair conditions, we were at last compelled to bring the matter
before God, determined to abide by whatever issue He might
decree. And we, as you know, came off victorious;<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> our brother
was beaten, and with his followers got away, each as best he
<span class="sidebar">The speech
of Louis the
German</span>
could. Then we, moved by brotherly love and
having compassion on our Christian people, were
not willing to pursue and destroy them; but,
still, as before, we begged that justice might be done to each.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
He, however, after all this, not content with the judgment of
God, has not ceased to pursue me and my brother with hostile
purpose, and to harass our peoples with fire, plunder, and murder.
Wherefore we have been compelled to hold this meeting, and,
since we feared that you might doubt whether our faith was
fixed and our alliance secure, we have determined to make our
oaths thereto in your presence. And we do this, not from any
unfair greed, but in order that, if God, with your help, shall grant
us peace, we may the better provide for the common welfare.
But if, which God forbid, I shall dare to violate the oath which I
shall swear to my brother, then I absolve each one of you from
your allegiance and from the oath which you have sworn to
me."</p>

<p>After Charles had made the same speech in the <i>lingua romana</i>,
Louis, as the elder of the two, swore first to be faithful to his
alliance:</p>

<p><i>Pro Deo amur et pro christian poblo et nostro commun salvament,
dist di in avant, in quant Deus savir et podir me dunat, si</i>
<span class="sidebar">The oath
of Louis</span>
<i>salvaraeio cist meon fradre Karlo et in adiudha
et in cadhuna cosa, si cum om per dreit son fradra
salvar dist, in o quid il mi altresi fazet; et ab Ludher nul plaid
numquam prindrai, qui meon vol cist meon fradre Karle in damno
sit.</i><a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>When Louis had taken this oath, Charles swore the same thing
in the <i>lingua teudisca</i>:</p>

<p><i>In Godes minna ind in thes christianes folches ind unser bedhero
gealtnissi, fon thesemo dage frammordes, so fram so mir</i>
<span class="sidebar">The oath
of Charles</span>
<i>Got gewizci indi madh furgibit, so haldih tesan

<h4>25. The Treaty of Verdun (843)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>After the meeting at Strassburg, Charles and Louis advanced against
Lothair, who now abandoned Aachen and retreated southward past
Châlons-sur-Marne toward Lyons. When the brothers had come into
the vicinity of Châlons-sur-Saône, they were met by ambassadors from
Lothair who declared that he was weary of the struggle and was ready
to make peace if only his imperial dignity should be properly recognized
and the share of the kingdom awarded to him should be somewhat
the largest of the three. Charles and Louis accepted their brother's
overtures and June 15, 842, the three met on an island in the Saône
and signed preliminary articles of peace. It was agreed that a board
of a hundred and twenty prominent men should assemble October 1 at
Metz, on the Moselle, and make a definite division of the kingdom.
This body, with the three royal brothers, met at the appointed time,
but adjourned to Worms, and subsequently to Verdun, on the upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Meuse, in order to have the use of maps at the latter place. The treaty
which resulted during the following year was one of the most important
in all mediæval times. Unfortunately the text of it has not survived,
but all its more important provisions are well known from
the writings of the chroniclers of the period. Two such accounts of
the treaty, brief but valuable, are given below.</p>

<p>Louis had been the real sovereign of Bavaria for sixteen years and
to his kingdom were now added all the German districts on the right
bank of the Rhine (except Friesland), together with Mainz, Worms,
and Speyer on the left bank, under the general name of <i>Francia
Orientalis</i>. Charles retained the western countries&mdash;Aquitaine, Gascony,
Septimania, the Spanish March, Burgundy west of the Saône,
Neustria, Brittany, and Flanders&mdash;designated collectively as <i>Francia
Occidentalis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The intervening belt of lands, including the two capitals
Rome and Aachen, and extending from Terracina in Italy to the North
Sea, went to Lothair.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> With it went the more or less nominal imperial
dignity. In general, Louis's portion represented the coming Germany
and Charles's the future France. But that of Lothair was utterly lacking
in either geographical or racial unity and was destined not long
to be held together. Parts of it, particularly modern Alsace and Lorraine,
have remained to this day a bone of contention between the
states on the east and west. "The partition of 843," says Professor
Emerton, "involved, so far as we know, nothing new in the relations
of the three brothers to each other. The theory of the empire was
preserved, but the meaning of it disappeared. There is no mention
of any actual superiority of the Emperor (Lothair) over his brothers,
and there is nothing to show that the imperial name was anything
but an empty title, a memory of something great which men could not
quite let die, but which for a hundred years to come was to be powerless
for good or evil."<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The empire itself was never afterwards united
under the rule of one man, except for two years (885-887) in the time
of Charles the Fat.</p>

<p>Charles set out to find his brothers, and they met at Verdun.
By the division there made Louis received for his share all the
<span class="sidebar">A statement

country beyond the Rhine,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and on this side
Speyer, Worms, Mainz, and the territories belonging
to these cities. Lothair received that
which is between the Scheldt and the Rhine toward the sea, and
that lying beyond Cambrésis, Hainault, and the counties adjoining
on this side of the Meuse, down to the confluence of the Saône
and Rhone, and thence along the Rhone to the sea, together with
the adjacent counties. Charles received all the remainder, extending
to Spain. And when the oath was exchanged they went
their several ways.</p>

<p class="center">(b)</p>

<p>The realm had from early times been divided in three portions,
and in the month of August the three kings, coming together at
<span class="sidebar">Another from
those of Rudolph
of Fulda</span>
Verdun in Gaul, redivided it among themselves.
Louis received the eastern part, Charles the western.
Lothair, who was older than his brothers,
received the middle portion. After peace was firmly established
and oaths exchanged, each brother returned to his dominion to
control and protect it. Charles, presuming to regard Aquitaine
as belonging properly to his share, was given much trouble by
his nephew Pepin,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> who annoyed him by frequent incursions and
caused great loss.</p>

<h4>26. A Chronicle of the Frankish Kingdom in the Ninth Century</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The following passages from the Annals of Xanten are here given
for two purposes&mdash;to show something of the character of the period
of the Carolingian decline, and to illustrate the peculiar features of
the mediæval chronicle. Numerous names, places, and events neither
very clearly understood now, nor important if they were understood,
occur in the text, and some of these it is not deemed worth while to
attempt to explain in the foot-notes. The selection is valuable for the
general impressions it gives rather than for the detailed facts which
it contains, though some of the latter are interesting enough.</p>

<p>Annals as a type of historical writing first assumed considerable
importance in western Europe in the time of Charles Martel and
Charlemagne. Their origin, like that of most forms of mediæval literary
production, can be traced directly to the influence of the Church.
The annals began as mere occasional notes jotted down by the monks
upon the "Easter tables," which were circulated among the monasteries
so that the sacred festival might not fail to be observed at the proper
date. The Easter tables were really a sort of calendar, and as they
were placed on parchment having a broad margin it was very natural
that the monks should begin to write in the margin opposite the various
years some of the things that had happened in those years. An Easter
table might pass through a considerable number of hands and so have
events recorded upon it by a good many different men. All sorts of
things were thus made note of&mdash;some important, some unimportant&mdash;and
of course it is not necessary to suppose that everything written
down was actually true. Many mistakes were possible, especially as
the writer often had only his memory, or perhaps mere hearsay, to
rely upon. And when, as frequently happened, these scattered Easter
tables were brought together in some monastery and there revised,
fitted together, and written out in one continuous chronicle, there were
chances at every turn for serious errors to creep in. The compilers
were sometimes guilty of wilful misrepresentation, but more often
their fault was only their ignorance, credulity, and lack of critical
discernment. In these annals there was no attempt to write history
as we now understand it; that is, the chroniclers did not undertake
to work out the causes and results and relations of things. They merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
recorded year by year such happenings as caught their attention&mdash;the
succession of a new pope, the death of a bishop, the coronation of
a king, a battle, a hail-storm, an eclipse, the birth of a two-headed
calf&mdash;all sorts of unimportant, and from our standpoint ridiculous,
items being thrown in along with matters of world-wide moment.
Heterogeneous as they are, however, the large collections of annals
that have come down to us have been used by modern historians with
the greatest profit, and but for them we should know far less than we
do about the Middle Ages, and especially about the people and events
of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries.</p>

<p>The Annals of Xanten here quoted are the work originally of a number
of ninth century monks. The fragments from which they were
ultimately compiled are thought to have been brought together at
Cologne, or at least in that vicinity. They cover especially the years
831-873.</p>

<p><b>844.</b> Pope Gregory departed this world and Pope Sergius
followed in his place.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Count Bernhard was killed by Charles.
Pepin, king of Aquitaine, together with his son and the son of
Bernhard, routed the army of Charles,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and there fell the abbot
Hugo. At the same time King Louis advanced with his army
against the Wends,<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> one of whose kings, Gestimus by name,
was killed; the rest came to Louis and pledged him their fidelity,
which, however, they broke as soon as he was gone. Thereafter
Lothair, Louis, and Charles came together for council in Diedenhofen,
and after a conference they went their several ways in
peace.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p><b>845.</b> Twice in the canton of Worms there was an earthquake;
the first in the night following Palm Sunday, the second in the
<span class="sidebar">The Northmen
in Frisia and
Gaul</span>
holy night of Christ's Resurrection. In the same
year the heathen<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> broke in upon the Christians
at many points, but more than twelve thousand
of them were killed by the Frisians. Another party of invaders
devastated Gaul; of these more than six hundred men perished.
Yet, owing to his indolence, Charles agreed to give them many
thousand pounds of gold and silver if they would leave Gaul, and
this they did. Nevertheless the cloisters of most of the saints
were destroyed and many of the Christians were led away
captive.</p>

<p>After this had taken place King Louis once more led a force
against the Wends. When the heathen had learned this they
sent ambassadors, as well as gifts and hostages, to Saxony, and
asked for peace. Louis then granted peace and returned home
from Saxony. Thereafter the robbers were afflicted by a terrible
pestilence, during which the chief sinner among them, by the
name of Reginheri, who had plundered the Christians and the
holy places, was struck down by the hand of God. They then
took counsel and threw lots to determine from which of their gods
they should seek safety; but the lots did not fall out happily, and
on the advice of one of their Christian prisoners that they should
cast their lot before the God of the Christians, they did so, and
the lot fell happily. Then their king, by the name of Rorik,
together with all the heathen people, refrained from meat and
drink for fourteen days, when the plague ceased, and they sent
back all their Christian prisoners to their country.</p>

<p><b>846.</b> According to their custom, the Northmen plundered
eastern and western Frisia and burned the town
<span class="sidebar">The Northmen
again in Frisia</span>
of Dordrecht, with two other villages, before
the eyes of Lothair, who was then in the castle of Nimwegen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
but could not punish the crime. The Northmen, with their boats
filled with immense booty, including both men and goods, returned
to their own country.</p>

<p>In the same year Louis sent an expedition from Saxony
against the Wends across the Elbe. He personally, however,
went with his army against the Bohemians, whom we call Beuwinitha,
but with great risk.... Charles advanced against
the Britons, but accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>At this same time, as no one can mention or hear without great
sadness, the mother of all churches, the basilica of the apostle
<span class="sidebar">Rome
attacked by
the Saracens</span>
Peter, was taken and plundered by the Moors, or
Saracens, who had already occupied the region of
Beneventum.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The Saracens, moreover, slaughtered
all the Christians whom they found outside the walls
of Rome, either within or without this church. They also carried
men and women away prisoners. They tore down, among many
others, the altar of the blessed Peter, and their crimes from day to
day bring sorrow to Christians. Pope Sergius departed life this
year.</p>

<p><b>847.</b> After the death of Sergius no mention of the apostolic
see has come in any way to our ears. Rabanus [Maurus], master
and abbot of Fulda,<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> was solemnly chosen archbishop as the successor
of Bishop Otger, who had died. Moreover, the Northmen
here and there plundered the Christians and engaged in a battle
with the counts Sigir and Liuthar. They continued up the Rhine
as far as Dordrecht, and nine miles farther to Meginhard, when
they turned back, having taken their booty.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p><b>848.</b> On the fourth of February, towards evening, it lightened
and there was thunder heard. The heathen, as was their custom,
<span class="sidebar">An outbreak
of heresy
repressed</span>
inflicted injury on the Christians. In the same
year King Louis held an assembly of the people
near Mainz. At this synod a heresy was brought
forward by a few monks in regard to predestination. These
were convicted and beaten, to their shame, before all the people.
They were sent back to Gaul whence they had come, and, thanks
be to God, the condition of the Church remained uninjured.</p>

<p><b>849.</b> While King Louis was ill, his army of Bavaria took its
way against the Bohemians. Many of these were killed and the
remainder withdrew, much humiliated, into their own country.
The heathen from the North wrought havoc in Christendom
as usual and grew greater in strength; but it is painful to say
more of this matter.</p>

<p><b>850.</b> On January 1st of that season, in the octave of the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
towards evening, a great deal of thunder was heard and a mighty
flash of lightning seen; and an overflow of water afflicted the
human race during this winter. In the following summer an all
too great heat of the sun burned the earth. Leo, pope of the
<span class="sidebar">Further ravages
by the
Northmen and
the Saracens</span>
apostolic see, an extraordinary man, built a fortification
around the church of St. Peter the apostle.
The Moors, however, devastated here and there
the coast towns in Italy. The Norman Rorik, brother of the
above-mentioned younger Heriold, who earlier had fled dishonored
from Lothair, again took Dordrecht and did much evil
treacherously to the Christians. In the same year so great a
peace existed between the two brothers&mdash;Emperor Lothair and
King Louis&mdash;that they spent many days together in Osning
[Westphalia] and there hunted, so that many were astonished
thereat; and they went each his way in peace.</p>

<p><b>851.</b> The bodies of certain saints were sent from Rome to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Saxony&mdash;that of Alexander, one of seven brethren, and those of
Romanus and Emerentiana. In the same year the very noble
Empress, Irmingard by name, wife of the Emperor Lothair,
<span class="sidebar">The Northmen
again in Frisia
and Saxony</span>
departed this world. The Normans inflicted
much harm in Frisia and about the Rhine. A
mighty army of them collected by the River
Elbe against the Saxons, and some of the Saxon towns were
besieged, others burned, and most terribly did they oppress the
Christians. A meeting of our kings took place on the Maas
[Meuse].</p>

<p><b>852.</b> The steel of the heathen glistened; excessive heat; a
famine followed. There was not fodder enough for the animals.
The pasturage for the swine was more than sufficient.</p>

<p><b>853.</b> A great famine in Saxony, so that many were forced to
live on horse meat.</p>

<p><b>854.</b> The Normans, in addition to the very many evils which
<span class="sidebar">The Northmen
burn the church
of St. Martin
at Tours</span>
they were everywhere inflicting upon the Christians,
burned the church of St. Martin, bishop
of Tours, where his body rests.</p>

<p><b>855.</b> In the spring Louis, the eastern king, sent his son of the
same name to Aquitaine to obtain possession of the heritage of
his uncle Pepin.</p>

<p><b>856.</b> The Normans again chose a king of the same name as
the preceding one, and related to him, and the Danes made a
fresh incursion by sea, with renewed forces, against the Christians.</p>

<p><b>857.</b> A great sickness prevailed among the people. This produced
a terrible foulness, so that the limbs were separated from
the body even before death came.</p>

<p><b>858.</b> Louis, the eastern king, held an assembly of the people
of his territory in Worms.</p>

<p><b>859.</b> On the first of January, as the early Mass was being said,
a single earthquake occurred in Worms and a triple one in Mainz
before daybreak.</p>

<p><b>860.</b> On the fifth of February thunder was heard. The king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
returned from Gaul after the whole empire had gone to destruction,
and was in no way bettered.</p>

<p><b>861.</b> The holy bishop Luitbert piously furnished the cloister
which is called the Freckenhorst with many relics of the saints,
<span class="sidebar">Sacred relics
brought together
at the
Freckenhorst</span>
namely, of the martyrs Boniface and Maximus,
and of the confessors Eonius and Antonius,
and added a portion of the manger of the Lord
and of His grave, and likewise of the dust of the Lord's feet as He
ascended to heaven. In this year the winter was long and the
above-mentioned kings again had a secret consultation on the
island near Coblenz, and they laid waste everything round
about.</p>

<h4>27. The Northmen in the Country of the Franks.</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Under the general name of Northmen in the ninth and tenth centuries
were included all those peoples of pure Teutonic stock who
inhabited the two neighboring peninsulas of Denmark and Scandinavia.
In this period, and after, they played a very conspicuous part in the
history of western Europe&mdash;at first as piratical invaders along the
Atlantic coast, and subsequently as settlers in new lands and as conquerors
and state-builders. <i>Northmen</i> was the name by which the
people of the continent generally knew them, but to the Irish they
were known as <i>Ostmen</i> or <i>Eastmen</i>, and to the English as <i>Danes</i>, while
the name which they applied to themselves was <i>Vikings</i> ["Creekmen"].
Their prolonged invasions and plunderings, which fill so large a place
in the ninth and tenth century chronicles of England and France, were
the result of several causes and conditions: (1) their natural love of
adventure, common to all early Germanic peoples; (2) the fact that
the population of their home countries had become larger than the
limited resources of these northern regions would support; (3) the
proximity of the sea on every side, with its fiords and inlets inviting
the adventurer to embark for new shores; and (4) the discontent of
the nobles, or jarls, with the growing rigor of kingly government. In
consequence of these and other influences large numbers of the people
became pirates, with no other occupation than the plundering of the
more civilized and wealthier countries to the east, west, and south.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Those from Sweden visited most commonly the coasts of Russia, those
from Norway went generally to Scotland and Ireland, and those from
Denmark to England and France. In fast-sailing vessels carrying
sixty or seventy men, and under the leadership of "kings of the sea"
who never "sought refuge under a roof, nor emptied their drinking-horns
at a fireside," they darted along the shores, ascended rivers,
converted islands into temporary fortresses, and from thence sallied
forth in every direction to burn and pillage and carry off all the booty
upon which they could lay hands. So swift and irresistible were their
operations that they frequently met with not the slightest show of
opposition from the terrified inhabitants.</p>

<p>It was natural that Frankland, with its numerous large rivers flowing
into the ocean and leading through fertile valleys dotted with towns
and rich abbeys, should early have attracted the marauders; and in
fact they made their appearance there as early as the year 800. Before
the end of Charlemagne's reign they had pillaged Frisia, and a monkish
writer of the time tells us that upon one occasion the great Emperor
burst into tears and declared that he was overwhelmed with sorrow
as he looked forward and saw what evils they would bring upon his
offspring and people. Whether or not this story is true, certain it is
that before the ninth century was far advanced incursions of the
barbarians&mdash;"the heathen," as the chroniclers generally call them&mdash;had
come to be almost annual events. In 841 Rouen was plundered
and burned; in 843 Nantes was besieged, the bishop killed, and many
captives carried off; in 845 the invaders appeared at Paris and were
prevented from attacking the place only by being bribed; and so the
story goes, until by 846 we find the annalists beginning their melancholy
record of the year's events with the matter-of-course statement
that, "according to their custom," the Northmen plundered such and
such a region [see <a href="#Page_159">p. 159</a>]. Below are a few passages taken from the
Annals of Saint-Bertin, the poem of Abbo on the siege of Paris, and the
Chronicle of Saint-Denys, which show something of the character of
the Northmen's part in early French history, first as mere invaders
and afterwards as permanent settlers.</p>

<p>The Annals of Saint-Bertin are so called because they have been
copied from an old manuscript found in the monastery of that name.
The period which they cover is 741-882. Several writers evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
had a hand in their compilation. The portion between the dates 836
and 861 is attributed to Prudence, bishop of Troyes, and that between
861 and 882 to Hincmar, archbishop of Rheims.</p>

<p>Abbo, the author of the second selection given below, was a monk
of St. Germain des Prés, at Paris. He wrote a poem in which he undertook
to give an account of the siege of Paris by the Northmen in 885
and 886, and of the struggles of the Frankish people with the invaders
to the year 896. As literature the poem has small value, but for the
historian it possesses some importance.</p>

<p>The account of Rollo's conversion comes from a history of the Normans
written in the twelfth century by William of Jumièges. The
work covers the period 851-1137, its earlier portions (to 996) being
based on an older history written by Dudo, dean of St. Quentin, in the
eleventh century. The Chronicle of St.-Denys was composed at a
later time and served to preserve most of the history recorded by
Dudo and William of Jumièges.</p>

the bishop and many of the clergy and laymen, both men and
women, and pillaged the city. Thence they set out to plunder
the lands of lower Aquitaine. At length they arrived at a certain
island<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and carried materials thither from the mainland to build
themselves houses; and they settled there for the winter, as if

them by the attacks of the cross-bowmen who had come to resist
them, part by being overwhelmed by a storm at sea. But others
of them went farther into Spain and engaged in long and desperate
combats with the Saracens; defeated in the end, they withdrew.</p>

<p><b>845.</b> The Northmen with a hundred ships entered the Seine on
the twentieth of March and, after ravaging first one bank and
<span class="sidebar">The Northmen
bought off at
Paris</span>
then the other, came without meeting any resistance
to Paris. Charles<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> resolved to hold out
against them; but seeing the impossibility of
gaining a victory, he made with them a certain agreement and
by a gift of 7,000 livres he bought them off from advancing farther
and persuaded them to return.</p>

<p>Euric, king of the Northmen, advanced, with six hundred
vessels, along the course of the River Elbe to attack Louis of
Germany.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The Saxons prepared to meet him, gave battle, and
with the aid of our Lord Jesus Christ won the victory.</p>

<p>The Northmen returned [from Paris] down the Seine and coming
to the ocean pillaged, destroyed, and burned all the regions
along the coast.</p>

<p><b>846.</b> The Danish pirates landed in Frisia.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> They were able to
force from the people whatever contributions they wished and,
being victors in battle, they remained masters of almost the
entire province.</p>

<p><b>847.</b> The Northmen made their appearance in the part of Gaul
inhabited by the Britons<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and won three victories. Noménoé,<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>

although defeated, at length succeeded in buying them off with
presents and getting them out of his country.</p>

<p><b>853-854.</b> The Danish pirates, making their way into the
country eastward from the city of Nantes, arrived without
<span class="sidebar">The burning
of Tours</span>
opposition, November eighth, before Tours. This
they burned, together with the church of St.
Martin and the neighboring places. But that incursion had been
foreseen with certainty and the body of St. Martin had been
removed to Cormery, a monastery of that church, and from there
to the city of Orleans. The pirates went on to the château of
Blois<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> and burned it, proposing then to proceed to Orleans and
destroy that city in the same fashion. But Agius, bishop of
Orleans, and Burchard, bishop of Chartres,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> had gathered soldiers
and ships to meet them; so they abandoned their design and returned
to the lower Loire, though the following year [855] they
ascended it anew to the city of Angers.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p><b>855.</b> They left their ships behind and undertook to go overland
to the city of Poitiers;<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> but the Aquitanians came to meet
them and defeated them, so that not more than 300 escaped.</p>

<p><b>856.</b> On the eighteenth of April, the Danish pirates came to
the city of Orleans, pillaged it, and went away without meeting
<span class="sidebar">Orleans
pillaged</span>
opposition. Other Danish pirates came into the
Seine about the middle of August and, after
plundering and ruining the towns on the two banks of the river,
and even the monasteries and villages farther back, came to a
well located place near the Seine called Jeufosse, and, there
quietly passed the winter.</p>

<p><b>859.</b> The Danish pirates having made a long sea-voyage (for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
they had sailed between Spain and Africa) entered the Rhone,
where they pillaged many cities and monasteries and established
themselves on the island called Camargue.... They devastated
everything before them as far as the city of Valence.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Then
after ravaging all these regions they returned to the island where
they had fixed their habitation. Thence they went on toward
Italy, capturing and plundering Pisa and other cities.</p>

<p><b>885.</b> The Northmen came to Paris with 700 sailing ships, not
counting those of smaller size which are commonly called barques.
At one stretch the Seine was lined with the vessels for more than
two leagues, so that one might ask in astonishment in what
cavern the river had been swallowed up, since it was not to be
seen. The second day after the fleet of the Northmen arrived
<span class="sidebar">The Northmen

under the walls of the city, Siegfred, who was
then king only in name<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> but who was in command
of the expedition, came to the dwelling of the
illustrious bishop. He bowed his head and said: "Gauzelin, have
compassion on yourself and on your flock. We beseech you to
listen to us, in order that you may escape death. Allow us only
the freedom of the city. We will do no harm and we will see to
it that whatever belongs either to you or to Odo shall be strictly
respected." Count Odo, who later became king, was then the
defender of the city.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The bishop replied to Siegfred, "Paris has
been entrusted to us by the Emperor Charles, who, after God,
king and lord of the powerful, rules over almost all the world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
He has put it in our care, not at all that the kingdom may be
ruined by our misconduct, but that he may keep it and be assured
of its peace. If, like us, you had been given the duty of defending
these walls, and if you should have done that which you ask us to
do, what treatment do you think you would deserve?" Siegfred
replied, "I should deserve that my head be cut off and thrown
to the dogs. Nevertheless, if you do not listen to my demand,
on the morrow our war machines will destroy you with poisoned
arrows. You will be the prey of famine and of pestilence and
these evils will renew themselves perpetually every year." So
saying, he departed and gathered together his comrades.</p>

<p>In the morning the Northmen, boarding their ships, approached
the tower and attacked it.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> They shook it with their engines
<span class="sidebar">The attack
upon the tower</span>
and stormed it with arrows. The city resounded
with clamor, the people were aroused, the bridges
trembled. All came together to defend the tower. There Odo,
his brother Robert,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and the Count Ragenar distinguished themselves
for bravery; likewise the courageous Abbot Ebolus,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> the
nephew of the bishop. A keen arrow wounded the prelate, while
at his side the young warrior Frederick was struck by a sword.
Frederick died, but the old man, thanks to God, survived. There
perished many Franks; after receiving wounds they were lavish
of life. At last the enemy withdrew, carrying off their dead.
The evening came. The tower had been sorely tried, but its
foundations were still solid, as were also the narrow <i>baies</i> which
surmounted them. The people spent the night repairing it with
boards. By the next day, on the old citadel had been erected a
new tower of wood, a half higher than the former one. At sunrise
the Danes caught their first glimpse of it. Once more the latter
engaged with the Christians in violent combat. On every side
arrows sped and blood flowed. With the arrows mingled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
stones hurled by slings and war-machines; the air was filled with
<span class="sidebar">Fierce
fighting</span>
them. The tower which had been built during the night groaned
under the strokes of the darts, the city shook with
the struggle, the people ran hither and thither, the
bells jangled. The warriors rushed together to defend the tottering
tower and to repel the fierce assault. Among these warriors
two, a count and an abbot [Ebolus], surpassed all the rest in
courage. The former was the redoubtable Odo who never experienced
<span class="sidebar">The bravery of
Count Odo</span>
defeat and who continually revived the
spirits of the worn-out defenders. He ran along
the ramparts and hurled back the enemy. On those who were
secreting themselves so as to undermine the tower he poured oil,
wax, and pitch, which, being mixed and heated, burned the Danes
and tore off their scalps. Some of them died; others threw
themselves into the river to escape the awful substance....<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Paris was suffering not only from the sword outside
but also from a pestilence within which brought death to many
noble men. Within the walls there was not ground in which to
bury the dead.... Odo, the future king, was sent to Charles,
emperor of the Franks,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> to implore help for the stricken city.</p>

<p>One day Odo suddenly appeared in splendor in the midst of
three bands of warriors. The sun made his armor glisten and
<span class="sidebar">Odo's mission
to Emperor
Charles the
Fat</span>
greeted him before it illuminated the country
around. The Parisians saw their beloved chief
at a distance, but the enemy, hoping to prevent
his gaining entrance to the tower, crossed the Seine and took up
their position on the bank. Nevertheless Odo, his horse at a
gallop, got past the Northmen and reached the tower, whose
gates Ebolus opened to him. The enemy pursued fiercely the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
comrades of the count who were trying to keep up with him
and get refuge in the tower. [The Danes were defeated in the
attack.]</p>

<p>Now came the Emperor Charles, surrounded by soldiers of all
nations, even as the sky is adorned with resplendent stars. A
<span class="sidebar">Terms of peace
arranged by
Charles</span>
great throng, speaking many languages, accompanied
him. He established his camp at the foot
of the heights of Montmartre, near the tower.
He allowed the Northmen to have the country of Sens to plunder;<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
and in the spring he gave them 700 pounds of silver on condition
that by the month of March they leave France for their
own kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Then Charles returned, destined to an early

<p>The king had at first wished to give to Rollo the province of
Flanders, but the Norman rejected it as being too marshy. Rollo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
refused to kiss the foot of Charles when he received from him the
duchy of Normandy. "He who receives such a gift," said the
bishops to him, "ought to kiss the foot of the king." "Never,"
replied he, "will I bend the knee to any one, or kiss anybody's
foot." Nevertheless, impelled by the entreaties of the Franks,
he ordered one of his warriors to perform the act in his stead.
This man seized the foot of the king and lifted it to his lips,
kissing it without bending and so causing the king to tumble
over backwards. At that there was a loud burst of laughter
and a great commotion in the crowd of onlookers. King Charles,

themselves by the oath of the Catholic faith to
Rollo, swearing by their lives and their bodies and by the honor
of all the kingdom, that he might hold the land and transmit it to
his heirs from generation to generation throughout all time to
come. When these things had been satisfactorily performed,
the king returned in good spirits into his dominion, and Rollo
with Duke Robert set out for Rouen.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord 912 Rollo was baptized in holy water
in the name of the sacred Trinity by Franco, archbishop of
<span class="sidebar">Rollo becomes

their idols, received the name of Christ, and with one accord
desired to be baptized. Meanwhile the Norman duke made
ready for a splendid wedding and married the daughter of the
king [Gisela] according to Christian rites.</p>

<p>Rollo gave assurance of security to all those who wished to
dwell in his country. The land he divided among his followers,
and, as it had been a long time unused, he improved it by the
construction of new buildings. It was peopled by the Norman
warriors and by immigrants from outside regions. The duke
<span class="sidebar">His work

established for his subjects certain inviolable
rights and laws, confirmed and published by the
will of the leading men, and he compelled all his people to live
peaceably together. He rebuilt the churches, which had been
entirely ruined; he restored the temples, which had been destroyed
by the ravages of the pagans; he repaired and added to
the walls and fortifications of the cities; he subdued the Britons
who rebelled against him; and with the provisions obtained
from them he supplied all the country that had been granted
to him.</p>

<h4>28. Later Carolingian Efforts to Preserve Order</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The ninth century is chiefly significant in Frankish history as an
era of decline of monarchy and increase of the powers and independence
of local officials and magnates. Already by Charlemagne's death, in
814, the disruptive forces were at work, and under the relatively weak
successors of the great Emperor the course of decentralization went
on until by the death of Charles the Bald, in 877, the royal authority
had been reduced to a condition of insignificance. This century was
the formative period <i>par excellence</i> of the feudal system&mdash;a type of
social and economic organization which the conditions of the time
rendered inevitable and under which great monarchies tended to be
dissolved into a multitude of petty local states. Large landholders began
to regard themselves as practically independent; royal officials, particularly
the counts, refused to be parted from their positions and used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
them primarily to enhance their own personal authority; the churches
and monasteries stretched their royal grants of immunity so far as
almost to refuse to acknowledge any obligations to the central government.
In these and other ways the Carolingian monarchy was shorn
of its powers, and as it was quite lacking in money, lands, and soldiers
who could be depended on, there was little left for it to do but to legislate
and ordain without much prospect of being able to enforce its
laws and ordinances. The rapidity with which the kings of the period
were losing their grip on the situation comes out very clearly from a study
of the capitularies which they issued from time to time. In general
these capitularies, especially after about 840, testify to the disorder
everywhere prevailing, the usurpations of the royal officials, and the
popular contempt of the royal authority, and reiterate commands
for the preservation of order until they become fairly wearisome to
the reader. Royalty was at a bad pass and its weakness is reflected
unmistakably in its attempts to govern by mere edict without any backing
of enforcing power. In 843, 853, 856, 857, and many other years
of Charles the Bald's reign, elaborate decrees were issued prohibiting
brigandage and lawlessness, but with the tell-tale provision that violators
were to be "admonished with Christian love to repent," or that
they were to be punished "as far as the local officials could remember
them," or that the royal agents were themselves to take oath not to
become highway robbers! Sometimes the king openly confessed his
weakness and proceeded to implore, rather than to command, his subjects
to obey him.</p>

<p>The capitulary quoted below belongs to the last year of the short
reign of Carloman (882-884), son of Louis the Stammerer and grandson
of Charles the Bald. It makes a considerable show of power, ordaining
the punishment of criminals as confidently as if there had really
been means to assure its enforcement. But in truth all the provisions
in it had been embodied in capitularies of Carloman's predecessors with
scarcely perceptible effect, and there was certainly no reason to expect
better results now. With the nobles practicing, if not asserting, independence,
the churches and monasteries heeding the royal authority
hardly at all, the country being ravaged by Northmen and the people
turning to the great magnates for the protection they could no longer
get from the king, and the counts and <i>missi dominici</i> making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
their lands and offices the basis for hereditary local authority, the
king had come to be almost powerless in the great realm where less
than a hundred years before Charlemagne's word, for all practical
purposes, was law. Even Charlemagne himself, however, could have
done little to avert the state of anarchy which conditions too strong
for any sovereign to cope with had brought about.</p>

<h4>29. The Election of Hugh Capet (987).</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<div class="intro">
<p>The election of Hugh Capet as king of France in 987 marked the
establishment of the so-called Capetian line of monarchs, which occupied
the French throne in all not far from eight centuries&mdash;a record
not equaled by any other royal house in European history. The circumstances
of the election were interesting and significant. For more
than a hundred years there had been keen rivalry between the Carolingian
kings and one of the great ducal houses of the Franks, known as
the Robertians. In the disorder which so generally prevailed in France
in the ninth and tenth centuries, powerful families possessing extensive
lands and having large numbers of vassals and serfs were able to make
themselves practically independent of the royal power. The greatest of
these families was the Robertians, the descendants of Robert the Strong,
father of the Odo who distinguished himself at the siege of Paris in
885-886 [see <a href="#Page_170">p. 170</a>]. Between 888 and 987 circumstances brought it
about three different times that members of the Robertian house were
elevated to the Frankish throne (Odo, 888-898; Robert I., 922-923;
and Rudolph&mdash;related to the Robertians by marriage only,&mdash;923-936).
The rest of the time the throne was occupied by Carolingians (Charles
the Simple, 898-922; Louis IV., 936-954; Lothair, 954-986; and Louis V.,
986-987). With the death of the young king Louis V., in 987, the
last direct descendant of Charlemagne passed away and the question
of the succession was left for solution by the nobles and higher
clergy of the realm. As soon as the king was dead, such of these magnates
as were assembled at the court to attend the funeral bound
themselves by oath to take no action until a general meeting could
be held at Senlis (a few miles north of Paris) late in May, 987. The
proceedings of this general meeting are related in the passage below.
Apparently it had already been pretty generally agreed that the man
to be elected was Hugh Capet, great-grandson of Robert the Strong
and the present head of the famous Robertian house, and the speech
of Adalbero, archbishop of Rheims, of which Richer gives a resumé,
was enough to ensure this result. There was but one other claimant of
importance. That was the late king's uncle, Charles of Lower Lorraine.
He was not a man of force and Adalbero easily disposed of his candidacy,
though the rejected prince was subsequently able to make his successful
rival a good deal of trouble. Hugh owed his election to his large material
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
resources, the military prestige of his ancestors, the active support
of the Church, and the lack of direct heirs of the Carolingian dynasty.</p>

<p>Richer, the chronicler whose account of the election is given below,
was a monk living at Rheims at the time when the events occurred
which he describes. His "Four Books of Histories," discovered only in
1833, is almost our only considerable source of information on Frankish
affairs in the later tenth century. In his writing he endeavored to round
out his work into a real history and to give more than the bare outline
of events characteristic of the mediæval annalists. In this he was
only partially successful, being at fault mainly in indulging in too much
rhetoric and in allowing partisan motives sometimes to guide him in what
he said. His partisanship was on the side of the fallen Carolingians. The
period covered by the "Histories" is 888-995; they are therefore roughly
continuous chronologically with the Annals of Saint Bertin [see <a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>].</p>

serious counsel as to the choice of a successor, so
that the state may not suffer any injury through
neglect and the lack of a leader. On a former
occasion<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> we thought it advisable to postpone that deliberation
in order that each of you might be able to come here and, in the

have inspired in you, and that from all these different expressions
of opinion we might be able to find out what is the general will.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>"Here we are assembled. Let us see to it, by our prudence
and honor, that hatred shall not destroy reason, that love shall
<span class="sidebar">Election, not
heredity, the
true basis of
Frankish kingship</span>
not interfere with truth. We are aware that
Charles<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> has his partisans, who claim that the
throne belongs to him by right of birth. But if
we look into the matter, the throne is not acquired
by hereditary right, and no one ought to be placed at the
head of the kingdom unless he is distinguished, not only by nobility
of body, but also by strength of mind&mdash;only such a one as
honor and generosity recommend.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> We read in the annals of
rulers of illustrious descent who were deposed on account of
their unworthiness and replaced by others of the same, or even
lesser, rank.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>"What dignity shall we gain by making Charles king? He is
not guided by honor, nor is he possessed of strength. Then, too,
he has compromised himself so far as to have become the dependent
of a foreign king<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and to have married a girl taken from
among his own vassals. How could the great duke endure that
a woman of the low rank of vassal should become queen and
<span class="sidebar">Objections
to Charles
of Lorraine</span>
rule over him? How could he tender services
to this woman, when his equals, and even his
superiors, in birth bend the knee before him and
place their hands under his feet? Think of this seriously and
you will see that Charles must be rejected for his own faults
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
rather than on account of any wrong done by others. Make a
decision, therefore, for the welfare rather than for the injury of
the state. If you wish ill to your country, choose Charles to be
king; if you have regard for its prosperity, choose Hugh, the
illustrious duke.... Elect, then, the duke, a man who is
<span class="sidebar">Election of
Hugh Capet
urged</span>
recommended by his conduct, by his nobility,
and by his military following. In him you will
find a defender, not only of the state, but also of
your private interests. His large-heartedness will make him a
father to you all. Who has ever fled to him for protection without
receiving it? Who that has been deserted by his friends has
he ever failed to restore to his rights?"</p>

<p>This speech was applauded and concurred in by all, and by
unanimous consent the duke was raised to the throne. He was

<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />
ALFRED THE GREAT IN WAR AND IN PEACE</h3>

<h4>30. The Danes in England</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The earliest recorded visit of the Danes, or Northmen, to England
somewhat antedates the appearance of these peoples on the Frankish
coast in the year 800. In 787 three Danish vessels came to shore at
Warham in Dorset and their sailors slew the unfortunate reeve who
mistook them for ordinary foreign merchants and tried to collect
port dues from them. Thereafter the British coasts were never free
for many years at a time from the depredations of the marauders.
In 793 the famous church at Lindisfarne, in Northumberland, was
plundered; in 795 the Irish coasts began to suffer; in 833 a fleet of
twenty-five vessels appeared at the mouth of the Thames; in 834 twelve
hundred pillagers landed in Dorset; in 842 London and Rochester
were sacked and their population scattered; in 850 a fleet of 350 ships
carrying perhaps ten or twelve thousand men, wintered at the mouth
of the Thames and in the spring caused London again to suffer; and
from then on until the accession of King Alfred, in 871, destructive
raids followed one another with distressing frequency.</p>

<p>The account of the Danish invasions given below is taken from
a biography of King Alfred commonly attributed to Asser, a monk of
Welsh origin connected with the monastery of St. David (later bishop
of Sherborne) and a close friend and adviser of the great king. It gives
us some idea of the way in which Alfred led his people through the
darkest days in their history, and of the settlement known as the
"Peace of Alfred and Guthrum" by which the Danish leader became
a Christian and the way was prepared for the later division of the English
country between the two contending peoples.

Chronicles</i> (London, 1866), pp. 56-63.</p>

<p>In the year 871 Alfred, who up to that time had been of only
secondary rank, while his brothers were alive, by God's permission,
undertook the government of the whole kingdom, welcomed
by all the people. Indeed, if he had cared to, he might have done
so earlier, even while his brother was still alive;<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> for in wisdom
<span class="sidebar">Alfred becomes
king
(871)</span>
and other qualities he excelled all of his brothers,
and, moreover, he was courageous and victorious
in all his wars. He became king almost against
his will, for he did not think that he could alone withstand the
numbers and the fierceness of the pagans, though even during
the lifetime of his brothers he had carried burdens enough for
many men. And when he had ruled one month, with a small
band of followers and on very unequal terms, he fought a battle
with the entire army of the pagans. This was at a hill called
Wilton, on the south bank of the River Wily, from which river
the whole of that district is named.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> And after a long and fierce
engagement the pagans, seeing the danger they were in, and
no longer able to meet the attacks of their enemies, turned their
backs and fled. But, oh, shame to say, they deceived the English,
who pursued them too boldly, and, turning swiftly about, gained
the victory. Let no one be surprised to learn that the Christians
had only a small number of men, for the Saxons had been
worn out by eight battles with the pagans in one year. In
these they had slain one king, nine dukes, and innumerable
troops of soldiers. There had also been numberless skirmishes,
<span class="sidebar">The struggle
with the Danes</span>
both by day and by night, in which Alfred, with
his ministers and chieftains and their men, were
engaged without rest or relief against the pagans. How many
thousands of pagans fell in these skirmishes God only knows,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
over and above the numbers slain in the eight battles before mentioned.
In the same year the Saxons made peace with the invaders,
on condition that they should take their departure, and
they did so.</p>

<p>In the year 877 the pagans, on the approach of autumn,
partly settled in Exeter<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and partly marched for plunder into
Mercia.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The number of that disorderly horde increased every
day, so that, if thirty thousand of them were slain in one battle,
others took their places to double the number. Then King Alfred
commanded boats and galleys, i.e., long ships, to be built
throughout the kingdom, in order to offer battle by sea to
the enemy as they were coming.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> On board these he placed
<span class="sidebar">Alfred's plan
to meet the
pagans on the
sea</span>

sailors, whom he commanded to keep watch on
the seas. Meanwhile he went himself to Exeter,
where the pagans were wintering and, having
shut them up within the walls, laid siege to the town. He also
gave orders to his sailors to prevent the enemy from obtaining
any supplies by sea. In a short time the sailors were encountered
by a fleet of a hundred and twenty ships full of armed soldiers,
who were on their way to the relief of their countrymen. As soon
as the king's men knew that the ships were manned by pagan
soldiers they leaped to their arms and bravely attacked those
barbaric tribes. The pagans, who had now for almost a month
been tossed and almost wrecked among the waves of the sea,
fought vainly against them. Their bands were thrown into
confusion in a very short time, and all were sunk and drowned
in the sea, at a place called Swanwich.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>In 878, which was the thirtieth year of King Alfred's life, the
pagan army left Exeter and went to Chippenham. This latter
place was a royal residence situated in the west of Wiltshire, on
the eastern bank of the river which the Britons called the Avon.
They spent the winter there and drove many of the inhabitants
of the surrounding country beyond the sea by the force of their
arms, and by the want of the necessities of life. They reduced
almost entirely to subjection all the people of that country.</p>

<p>The same year, after Easter, King Alfred, with a few followers,
made for himself a stronghold in a place called Athelney,<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and
<span class="sidebar">Alfred in
refuge at
Athelney</span>
from thence sallied, with his companions and the
nobles of Somersetshire, to make frequent assaults
upon the pagans. Also, in the seventh week
after Easter, he rode to Egbert's stone, which is in the eastern
part of the wood that is called Selwood.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Here he was met
by all the folk of Somersetshire and Wiltshire and Hampshire,
who had not fled beyond the sea for fear of the pagans; and
when they saw the king alive after such great tribulation they
received him, as he deserved, with shouts of joy, and encamped
there for one night. At dawn on the following day the king broke
camp and went to Okely, where he encamped for one night.
The next morning he moved to Ethandune<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and there fought
bravely and persistently against the whole army of the pagans.
<span class="sidebar">The battle of
Ethandune and
the establishment
of peace
(878)</span>
By the help of God he defeated them with great
slaughter and pursued them flying to their fortification.
He at once slew all the men and carried
off all the booty that he could find outside the
fortress, which he immediately laid siege to with his entire army.
And when he had been there fourteen days the pagans, driven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
by famine, cold, fear, and finally by despair, asked for peace on
the condition that they should give the king as many hostages
as he should ask, but should receive none from him in return.
Never before had they made a treaty with any one on such terms.
The king, hearing this, took pity upon them and received such
hostages as he chose. Then the pagans swore that they would
immediately leave the kingdom, and their king, Guthrum,
promised to embrace Christianity and receive baptism at Alfred's
hands. All of these pledges he and his men fulfilled as they had
promised.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<h4>31. Alfred's Interest in Education</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>As an epoch of literary and educational advancement the reign of
Alfred in England (871-901) was in many respects like that of Charlemagne
among the Franks (768-814). Like Charlemagne, Alfred grew
up with very slight education, at least of a literary sort; but both sovereigns
were strongly dissatisfied with their ignorance, and both made
earnest efforts to overcome their own defects and at the same time
to raise the standard of intelligence among their people at large. When
one considers how crowded were the reigns of both with wars and the
pressing business of administration, such devotion to the interests of
learning appears the more deserving of praise.</p>

<p>In the first passage below, taken from Asser's life of Alfred, the
anxiety of the king for the promotion of his own education and that
of his children is clearly and strongly stated. We find him following
Charlemagne's plan of bringing scholars from foreign countries. He
brought them, too, from parts of Britain not under his direct control,
and used them at the court, or in bishoprics, to perform the work of
instruction. Curiously enough, whereas Charlemagne had found the
chief of his Palace School, Alcuin, in England, Alfred was glad to
secure the services of two men (Grimbald and John) who had made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
their reputations in monasteries situated within the bounds of the old
Frankish empire.</p>

<p>Aside from some native songs and epic poems, all the literature
known to the Saxon people was in Latin, and but few persons in the
kingdom knew Latin well enough to read it. The king himself did not,
until about 887. It was supposed, of course, that the clergy were
able to use the Latin Bible and the Latin ritual of the Church, but
when Alfred came to investigate he found that even these men were
often pretty nearly as ignorant as the people they were charged to
instruct. What the king did, then, was to urge more study on the part
of the clergy, under the direction of such men as Plegmund, Asser, Grimbald,
John, and Werfrith. The people in general could not be expected
to master a foreign language; hence, in order that they might
not be shut off entirely from the first-hand use of books, Alfred undertook
the translation of certain standard works from the Latin into the
Saxon. Those thus translated were Boethius's <i>Consolations of Philosophy</i>,
Orosius's <i>Universal History of the World</i>, Bede's <i>Ecclesiastical
History of England</i>, and Pope Gregory the Great's <i>Pastoral Rule</i>. The
second passage given below is Alfred's preface to his Saxon edition of
the last-named book, taking the form of a letter to the scholarly
Bishop Werfrith of Worcester. The <i>Pastoral Rule</i> [see <a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>] was
written by Pope Gregory the Great (590-604) as a body of instructions
in doctrine and conduct for the clergy. Alfred's preface, as a
picture of the ruin wrought by the long series of Danish wars, is of
the utmost importance in the study of ninth and tenth century England,
as well as a most interesting revelation of the character of the
great king.</p>

<p>Ethelwerd, the youngest [of Alfred's children],<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> by the divine
counsels and the admirable prudence of the king, was consigned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
to the schools of learning, where, with the children of almost all
the nobility of the country, and many also who were not noble,
he prospered under the diligent care of his teachers. Books in
both languages, namely, Latin and Saxon, were read in the school.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
<span class="sidebar">The education
of Alfred's
children</span>
They also learned to write, so that before they
were of an age to practice manly arts, namely,
hunting and such pursuits as befit noblemen,
they became studious and clever in the liberal arts. Edward<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
and Ælfthryth<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> were reared in the king's court and received
great attention from their attendants and nurses; nay, they continue
to this day with the love of all about them, and showing
friendliness, and even gentleness, towards all, both natives and
foreigners, and in complete subjection to their father. Nor,
among their other studies which pertain to this life and are fit
for noble youths, are they suffered to pass their time idly and
unprofitably without learning the liberal arts; for they have
carefully learned the Psalms and Saxon books, especially the
Saxon poems, and are continually in the habit of making use of
books.</p>

<p>In the meantime the king, during the frequent wars and other
hindrances of this present life, the invasions of the pagans, and
<span class="sidebar">The varied activities
of the
king</span>
his own infirmities of body, continued to carry
on the government, and to practice hunting in
all its branches; to teach his workers in gold and
artificers of all kinds, his falconers, hawkers and dog-keepers; to
build houses, majestic and splendid, beyond all the precedents of
his ancestors, by his new mechanical inventions; to recite the
Saxon books, and especially to learn by heart the Saxon poems,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
and to make others learn them.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> And he alone never desisted
from studying most diligently to the best of his ability. He attended
the Mass and other daily services of religion. He was
<span class="sidebar">His devout
character</span>
diligent in psalm-singing and prayer, at the hours
both of the day and of the night. He also went
to the churches, as we have already said, in the night-time to
pray, secretly and unknown to his courtiers. He bestowed alms
and gifts on both natives and foreigners of all countries. He was
affable and pleasant to all, and curiously eager to investigate
things unknown. Many Franks, Frisians, Gauls, pagans, Britons,
Scots, and Armoricans,<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> noble and low-born, came voluntarily
to his domain; and all of them, according to their nation and
deserving, were ruled, loved, honored and enriched with money
and power.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Moreover, the king was in the habit of hearing the
divine Scriptures read by his own countrymen, or, if by any
chance it so happened, in company with foreigners, and he attended
to it with care and solicitude. His bishops, too, and all
ecclesiastics, his earls and nobles, ministers<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and friends, were
loved by him with wonderful affection, and their sons, who were
reared in the royal household, were no less dear to him than his
own. He had them instructed in all kinds of good morals, and,
among other things, never ceased to teach them letters night and
day.</p>

<p>But, as if he had no consolation in all these things, and though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
he suffered no other annoyance, either from within or without,
he was harassed by daily and nightly affliction, so that he
<span class="sidebar">Regret at his
lack of education</span>
complained to God and to all who were admitted
to his intimate fondness, that Almighty God had
made him ignorant of divine wisdom, and of
the liberal arts&mdash;in this emulating the pious, the wise, and
wealthy Solomon, king of the Hebrews, who at first, despising all
present glory and riches, asked wisdom of God and found both,
namely, wisdom and worldly glory; as it is written: "Seek first
the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things
shall be added unto you." But God, who is always the observer
of the thoughts of the mind within and the author of all good
intentions, and a most plentiful helper that good desires may be
formed (for He would not prompt a man to good intentions, unless
He also amply supplied that which the man justly and properly
wishes to have) stimulated the king's mind within: as it is written,
"I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me."
He would avail himself of every opportunity to procure co-workers
in his good designs, to aid him in his strivings after wisdom that
he might attain to what he aimed at. And, like a prudent bee,
which, going forth in summer with the early morning from its cell,
steers its rapid flight through the uncertain tracks of ether and
descends on the manifold and varied flowers of grasses, herbs,
and shrubs, discovering that which pleases most, that it may
bear it home, so did he direct his eyes afar and seek without
that which he had not within, that is, in his own kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>But God at that time, as some relief to the king's anxiety,
yielding to his complaint, sent certain lights to
<span class="sidebar">Learned men
from Mercia
brought to the
English court</span>
illuminate him, namely, Werfrith, bishop of the
church of Worcester, a man well versed in divine
Scripture, who, by the king's command, first turned the books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
of the Dialogues of Pope Gregory and Peter, his disciple, from
Latin into Saxon, and sometimes putting sense for sense, interpreted
them with clearness and elegance. After him was Plegmund,<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
a Mercian by birth, archbishop of the church of Canterbury,
a venerable man, and endowed with wisdom; Ethelstan
also,<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and Werwulf,<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> his priests and chaplains,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Mercians by birth
and learned. These four had been invited from Mercia by King
Alfred, who exalted them with many honors and powers in the
kingdom of the West Saxons, besides the privileges which Archbishop
Plegmund and Bishop Werfrith enjoyed in Mercia. By
their teaching and wisdom the king's desires increased unceasingly,
and were gratified. Night and day, whenever he had
leisure, he commanded such men as these to read books to him,
for he never suffered himself to be without one of them; wherefore
he possessed a knowledge of every book, though of himself he
could not yet understand anything of books, for he had not yet
learned to read anything.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>But the king's commendable desire could not be gratified even
<span class="sidebar">Grimbald and
John brought
from the continent</span>
in this; wherefore he sent messengers beyond the
sea to Gaul, to procure teachers, and he invited
from thence Grimbald,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> priest and monk, a venerable
man and good singer, adorned with every kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
ecclesiastical training and good morals, and most learned in
holy Scripture. He also obtained from thence John,<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> also priest
and monk, a man of most energetic talents, and learned in all
kinds of literary science, and skilled in many other arts. By
the teaching of these men the king's mind was much enlarged,
and he enriched and honored them with much influence.</p>

<p class="center">(b)</p>

<p>King Alfred greets Bishop Werfrith with loving words and with
friendship.</p>

<p>I let it be known to thee that it has very often come into my
mind what wise men there formerly were throughout England,
<span class="sidebar">Alfred writes
to Bishop Werfrith
on the
state of learning
in England</span>
both within the Church and without it; also what
happy times there were then and how the kings
who had power over the nation in those days
obeyed God and His ministers; how they cherished
peace, morality, and order at home, and at the same time enlarged
their territory abroad; and how they prospered both in
war and in wisdom. Often have I thought, also, of the sacred
orders, how zealous they were both in teaching and learning,
and in all the services they owed to God; and how foreigners
came to this land in search of wisdom and instruction, which
things we should now have to get from abroad if we were to have
them at all.</p>

<p>So general became the decay of learning in England that there
were very few on this side of the Humber<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> who could understand
the rituals<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> in English, or translate a letter from Latin into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
English; and I believe that there were not many beyond the
Humber who could do these things. There were so few, in fact,
that I cannot remember a single person south of the Thames
when I came to the throne. Thanks be to Almighty God that we
now have some teachers among us. And therefore I enjoin thee
to free thyself, as I believe thou art ready to do, from worldly
matters, that thou mayst apply the wisdom which God has given
thee wherever thou canst. Consider what punishments would
come upon us if we neither loved wisdom ourselves nor allowed
other men to obtain it. We should then care for the name only
of Christian, and have regard for very few of the Christian
virtues.</p>

<p>When I thought of all this I remembered also how I saw the
country before it had been all ravaged and burned; how the
churches throughout the whole of England stood filled with
treasures and books. There was also a great multitude of God's
servants, but they had very little knowledge of books, for they
could not understand anything in them because they were not
written in their own language.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> When I remembered all this I
<span class="sidebar">Learning in
the days before
the Danish
invasions</span>
wondered extremely that the good and wise men
who were formerly all over England and had
learned perfectly all the books, did not wish to
translate them into their own language. But again I soon
answered myself and said: "Their own desire for learning was
so great that they did not suppose that men would ever become
so indifferent and that learning would ever so decay; and they
wished, moreover, that wisdom in this land might increase with
our knowledge of languages." Then I remembered how the
law was first known in Hebrew and when the Greeks had learned
it how they translated the whole of it into their own tongue,<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
all other books besides. And again the Romans, when they had
learned it, translated the whole of it into their own language.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
And also all other Christian nations translated a part of it into
their languages.</p>

<p>Therefore it seems better to me, if you agree, for us also to
translate some of the books which are most needful for all men
<span class="sidebar">Plan to translate
Latin
books into
English</span>
to know into the language which we can all
understand. It shall be your duty to see to it,
as can easily be done if we have tranquility
enough,<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> that all the free-born youth now in England, who are
rich enough to be able to devote themselves to it, be set to learn
as long as they are not fit for any other occupation, until they are
well able to read English writing. And let those afterwards be
taught more in the Latin language who are to continue learning
and be promoted to a higher rank.</p>

<p>When I remembered how the knowledge of Latin had decayed
through England, and yet that many could read English writing,
I began, among other various and manifold troubles of this
kingdom, to translate into English the book which is called in
<span class="sidebar">The translation
of Pope
Gregory's Pastoral
Care</span>
Latin <i>Pastoralis</i>, and in English <i>The Shepherd's
Book</i>, sometimes word for word, and sometimes
according to the sense, as I had learned it from
Plegmund, my archbishop, and Asser, my bishop, and Grimbald,
my mass-priest, and John, my mass-priest. And when I had
learned it, as I could best understand it and most clearly interpret
it, I translated it into English.</p>

<p>I will send a copy of this book to every bishopric in my kingdom,
and on each copy there shall be a clasp worth fifty mancuses.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
And I command in God's name that no man take the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
clasp from the book, or the book from the minster.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> It is uncertain
how long there may be such learned bishops as, thanks be
to God, there now are almost everywhere; therefore, I wish these
copies always to remain in their places, unless the bishop desires
to take them with him, or they be loaned out anywhere, or any
one wishes to make a copy of them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />
THE ORDEAL</h3>

<h4>33. Tests by Hot Water, Cold Water, and Fire</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Among the early Germans the settling of disputes and the testing
of the guilt or innocence of an accused person were generally accomplished
through the employment of one or both of two very interesting
judicial practices&mdash;compurgation and the ordeal. According to the
German conception of justice, when one person was accused of wrongdoing
by another and chose to defend himself, he was not under obligation
to prove directly that he did not commit the alleged misdeed;
rather it was his business to produce, if he could, a sufficient number
of persons who would take oath that they believed the accused to
be a trustworthy man and that he was telling the truth when he
denied that he was guilty. The persons brought forward to take this
oath were known as compurgators, or "co-swearers," and the legal
act thus performed was called compurgation. The number of compurgators
required to free a man was usually from seven to twelve,
though it varied greatly among different tribes and according to the
rank of the parties involved. Naturally they were likely to be relatives
or friends of the accused man, though it was not essential that they
be such. It was in no wise expected that they be able to give facts or
evidence regarding the case; in other words, they were not to serve at
all as witnesses, such as are called in our courts to-day.</p>

<p>If the accused succeeded in producing the required number of compurgators,
and they took the oath in a satisfactory manner, the defendant
was usually declared to be innocent and the case was dropped.
If, however, the compurgators were not forthcoming, or there appeared
some irregularity in their part of the procedure, resort would
ordinarily be had to the ordeal. The ordeal was essentially an appeal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
to the gods for decision between two contending parties. It was based
on the belief that the gods would not permit an innocent person to
suffer by reason of an unjust accusation and that when the opportunity
was offered under certain prescribed conditions the divine power would
indicate who was in the right and who in the wrong. The ordeal, having
its origin far back in the times when the Germans were pagans
and before their settlements in the Roman Empire, was retained in
common usage after the Christianizing and civilizing of the barbarian
tribes. The administering of it simply passed from the old pagan
priests to the Christian clergy, and the appeals were directed to the
Christian's God instead of to Woden and Thor. Under Christian influence,
the wager of battle (or personal combat to settle judicial questions),
which had been exceedingly common, was discouraged as much
as possible, and certain new modes of appeal to divine authority were
introduced. Throughout the earlier Middle Ages the chief forms of
the ordeal were: (1) the ordeal by walking through fire; (2) the ordeal
by hot iron, in which the accused either carried a piece of hot iron a
certain distance in his hands or walked barefoot over pieces of the
same material; (3) the ordeal by hot water, in which the accused was
required to plunge his bared arm into boiling water and bring forth a
stone or other object from the bottom; (4) the ordeal by cold water,
in which the accused was thrown, bound hand and foot, into a pond or
stream, to sink if he were innocent, to float if he were guilty; (5) the
ordeal of the cross, in which the accuser and accused stood with arms
outstretched in the form of a cross until one of them could endure the
strain of the unnatural attitude no longer; (6) the ordeal of the sacrament,
in which the accused partook of the sacrament, the idea being
that divine vengeance would certainly fall upon him in so doing if he
were guilty; (7) the ordeal of the bread and cheese, in which the accused,
made to swallow morsels of bread and cheese, was expected to
choke if he were guilty; and (8) the judicial combat, which was generally
reserved for freemen, and which, despite the opposition of the
Church, did not die out until the end of the mediæval period.</p>

<p>The three passages quoted below illustrate, respectively, the ordeal
by hot water, by cold water, and by fire. The first (a) is a story told
by the Frankish historian Gregory of Tours [see <a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>]. The second (b)
is an explanation of the cold water ordeal written by Hincmar, an archbishop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
of Rheims in the ninth century. The third (c) is an account,
by Raymond of Agiles, of how Peter Bartholomew was put to the
test by the ordeal of fire. This incident occurred at Antioch during
the first crusade. Peter Bartholomew had just discovered a lance
which he claimed was the one thrust into the side of Christ at the
crucifixion and, some of the crusaders being skeptical as to the genuineness
of the relic, the discoverer was submitted to the ordeal by fire to
test the matter.</p>

<p>An Arian presbyter, disputing with a deacon of our religion,
made venomous assertions against the Son of God and the Holy
Ghost, as is the habit of that sect.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> But when the deacon had
discoursed a long time concerning the reasonableness of our faith,
and the heretic, blinded by the fog of unbelief, continued to reject
the truth (according as it is written, "Wisdom shall not enter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
the mind of the wicked") the former said: "Why weary ourselves
<span class="sidebar">A challenge to
the ordeal by
hot water</span>
with long discussions? Let acts demonstrate the truth.
Let a kettle be heated over the fire and some one's
ring be thrown into the boiling water. Let him
who shall take it from the heated liquid be approved
as a follower of the truth, and afterwards let the other
party be converted to the knowledge of this truth. And do thou
understand, O heretic, that this our party will fulfill the conditions
with the aid of the Holy Ghost; thou shalt confess that there
is no inequality, no dissimilarity, in the Holy Trinity." The
heretic consented to the proposition and they separated, after
appointing the next morning for the trial. But the fervor of
faith in which the deacon had first made this suggestion began
to cool through the instigation of the enemy [i.e., Satan]. Rising
with the dawn, he bathed his arm in oil and smeared it with
ointment. But nevertheless he made the round of the sacred
places and called in prayer on the Lord. What more shall I say?
About the third hour they met in the market place. The people
came together to see the show. A fire was lighted, the kettle was
<span class="sidebar">Preparations
for the ordeal</span>

placed upon it, and when it grew very hot the
ring was thrown into the boiling water. The
deacon invited the heretic to take it out of the water first. But
he promptly refused, saying, "Thou who didst propose this trial
art the one to take it out." The deacon, all of a tremble, bared
his arm. And when the heretic presbyter saw it besmeared with
ointment he cried out: "With magic arts thou hast thought to
protect thyself, that thou hast made use of these salves, but what
thou hast done will not avail." While they were thus quarreling,
there came up a deacon from Ravenna named Iacinthus, who
inquired what the trouble was about. When he learned the truth,
he drew his arm out from under his robe at once and plunged his
right hand into the kettle. Now the ring that had been thrown
in was a little thing and very light, so that it was tossed about
by the water as chaff would be blown about by the wind; and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
searching for it a long time, he found it after about an hour.
Meanwhile the flame beneath the kettle blazed up mightily, so
that the greater heat might make it difficult for the ring to be
followed by the hand; but the deacon extracted it at length and
<span class="sidebar">Result of the
ordeal</span>
suffered no harm, protesting rather that at the
bottom the kettle was cold while at the top it was
just pleasantly warm. When the heretic beheld this, he was
greatly confused and audaciously thrust his hand into the kettle
saying, "My faith will aid me." As soon as his hand had been
thrust in, all the flesh was boiled off the bones clear up to the
elbow. And so the dispute ended.</p>

<p class="center">(b)</p>

<p>Now the one about to be examined is bound by a rope and cast
into the water because, as it is written, "each one shall be holden
with the cords of his iniquity." And it is manifest that he is bound
for two reasons, namely, that he may not be able to practice any
fraud in connection with the judgment, and that he may be drawn
out at the right time if the water should receive him as innocent,
so that he perish not. For as we read that Lazarus, who had been
dead four days (by whom is signified each one buried under a
load of crimes), was buried wrapped in bandages and, bound by
the same bands, came forth from the sepulchre at the word of
<span class="sidebar">How the ordeal
of cold
water is to be
conducted</span>
the Lord and was loosed by the disciples at His
command; so he who is to be examined by this
judgment is cast into the water bound, and is
drawn forth again bound, and is either immediately set free by
the decree of the judges, being purged, or remains bound until
the time of his purgation and is then examined by the court....
And in this ordeal of cold water whoever, after the invocation
of God, who is the Truth, seeks to hide the truth by a
lie, cannot be submerged in the waters above which the voice of
the Lord God has thundered; for the pure nature of the water
recognizes as impure, and therefore rejects as inconsistent with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
itself, such human nature as has once been regenerated by the
waters of baptism and is again infected by falsehood.</p>

<p class="center">(c)</p>

<p>All these things were pleasing to us and, having enjoined on
him a fast, we declared that a fire should be prepared upon the
day on which the Lord was beaten with stripes and put upon
the cross for our salvation. And the fourth day thereafter was
the day before the Sabbath. So when the appointed day came
round, a fire was prepared after the noon hour. The leaders and
the people to the number of 60,000 came together. The priests
<span class="sidebar">Preparations
for the ordeal
by fire</span>
were there also with bare feet, clothed in ecclesiastical
garments. The fire was made of dry
olive branches, covering a space thirteen feet
long; and there were two piles, with a space about a foot wide
between them. The height of these piles was four feet. Now
when the fire had been kindled so that it burned fiercely, I, Raimond,
in the presence of the whole multitude, said: "If Omnipotent
God has spoken to this man face to face, and the blessed Andrew
has shown him our Lord's lance while he was keeping his
vigil,<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> let him go through the fire unharmed. But if it is false,
let him be burned, together with the lance, which he is to carry
in his hand." And all responded on bended knees, "Amen."</p>

<p>The fire was growing so hot that the flames shot up thirty
cubits high into the air and scarcely any one dared approach
<span class="sidebar">Peter Bartholomew
passes
through the
flames</span>
it. Then Peter Bartholomew, clothed only in
his tunic and kneeling before the bishop of Albar,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
called God to witness that "he had seen Him
face to face on the cross, and that he had heard from Him those
things above written."... Then, when the bishop had
placed the lance in his hand, he knelt and made the sign of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the cross and entered the fire with the lance, firm and unterrified.
For an instant's time he paused in the midst of the flames,
and then by the grace of God passed through.... But
when Peter emerged from the fire so that neither his tunic was
burned nor even the thin cloth with which the lance was wrapped
up had shown any sign of damage, the whole people received him,
after he had made over them the sign of the cross with the lance
in his hand and had cried, "God help us!" All the people, I
say, threw themselves upon him and dragged him to the ground
and trampled on him, each one wishing to touch him, or to get a
piece of his garment, and each thinking him near some one else.
And so he received three or four wounds in the legs where the
flesh was torn away, his back was injured, and his sides bruised.
Peter had died on the spot, as we believe, had not Raimond Pelet,
a brave and noble soldier, broken through the wild crowd with a
band of friends and rescued him at the peril of their lives....
After this, Peter died in peace at the hour appointed to him by
God, and journeyed to the Lord; and he was buried in the place
where he had carried the lance of the Lord through the fire.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
THE FEUDAL SYSTEM</h3>

<h4>34. Older Institutions Involving Elements of Feudalism</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The history of the feudal system in Europe makes up a very large
part of the history of the Middle Ages, particularly of the period between
the ninth and the fourteenth centuries. This is true because
feudalism, in one way or another, touched almost every phase of the
life of western Europe during this long era. More than anything else,
it molded the conditions of government, the character and course of
war, the administration of justice, the tenure of land, the manner of
everyday life, and even the relations of the Church with sovereigns
and people. "Coming into existence," says a French historian, "in
the obscure period that followed the dissolution of the Carolingian
empire, the feudal régime developed slowly, without the intervention
of a government, without the aid of a written law, without any general
understanding among individuals; rather only by a gradual transformation
of customs, which took place sooner or later, but in about the same
way, in France, Italy, Christian Spain, and Germany. Then, toward
the end of the eleventh century, it was transplanted into England and
into southern Italy, in the twelfth and thirteenth into the Latin states
of the East, and beginning with the fourteenth into the Scandinavian
countries. This régime, established thus not according to a general
plan but by a sort of natural growth, never had forms and usages that
were everywhere the same. It is impossible to gather it up into a
perfectly exact picture, which would not be in contradiction to several
cases."<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>The country in which feudalism reached its fullest perfection was
France and most of the passages here given to illustrate the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
have to do with French life and institutions. In France, speaking generally,
feudalism took shape during the ninth and tenth centuries,
developed steadily until the thirteenth, and then slowly declined,
leaving influences on society which have not yet all disappeared. When
the system was complete&mdash;say by the tenth century&mdash;we can see in it
three essential elements which may be described as the personal, the
territorial, and the governmental. The personal element, in brief, was
the relation between lord and vassal under which the former gave
protection in return for the latter's fidelity. The territorial element
was the benefice, or fief, granted to the vassal by the lord to be used
on certain conditions by the former while the title to it remained with
the latter. The governmental element was the rights of jurisdiction
over his fief usually given by a lord to his vassal, especially if the fief
were an important one. At one time it was customary to trace back
all these features of the feudal system to the institutions of Rome.
Later it became almost as customary to trace them to the institutions
of the early Germans. But recent scholarship shows that it is quite
unnecessary, in fact very misleading, to attempt to ascribe them wholly
to either Roman or German sources, or even to both together. All that
we can say is that in the centuries preceding the ninth these elements
all existed in the society of western Europe and that, while something
very like them ran far back into old Roman and German times, they
existed in sixth and seventh century Europe primarily because conditions
were then such as to <i>demand</i> their existence. Short extracts to
illustrate the most important of these old feudal elements are given
below. It should constantly be borne in mind that no one of these
things&mdash;whether vassalage, the benefice, or the immunity&mdash;was in itself
feudalism. Most of them could, and did, exist separately, and it was
only when they were united, as commonly became the case in the ninth
and tenth centuries, that the word feudalism can properly be brought
into use, and then only as applied to the complete product.</p>

<p class="center">(1) <span class="smcap">Vassalage</span></p>

<p>For the personal element in feudalism it is possible to find two prototypes,
one Roman and the other German. The first was the institution
of the later Empire known as the <i>patrocinium</i>&mdash;the relation established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
between a powerful man (patron) and a weak one (client) when the
latter pledged himself to perform certain services for the former in
return for protection. The second was the German <i>comitatus</i>&mdash;a band
of young warriors who lived with a prince or noble and went on campaigns
under his leadership. The <i>patrocinium</i> doubtless survived in
Roman Gaul long after the time of the Frankish invasion, but it is not
likely that the <i>comitatus</i> ever played much part in that country. It
seems that, with the exception of the king, the Frankish men of influence
did not have bands of personal followers after the settlement
on Roman soil. But, wholly aside from earlier practices, the conditions
which the conquest, and the later struggles of the rival kings,
brought about made it still necessary for many men who could not
protect themselves or their property to seek the favor of some one who
was strong enough to give them aid. The name which came to be
applied to the act of establishing this personal relation was <i>commendation</i>.
The man who promised the protection was the lord, and the man
who pledged himself to serve the lord and be faithful to him was the
<i>homo</i>, after the eighth century known as the vassal (<i>vassus</i>). In the
eighth century, when the power of the Merovingian kings was ebbing
away and the people were left to look out for themselves, large numbers
entered into the vassal relation; and in the ninth century, when
Carolingian power was likewise running low and the Northmen, Hungarians,
and Saracens were ravaging the country, scarcely a free man
was left who did not secure for himself the protection of a lord. The
relation of vassalage was first recognized as legal in the capitularies of

has decreed to me, that I should hand myself over, or commend
myself, to your guardianship, which I have thereupon
done; that is to say, in this way, that you should aid and succor
me, as well with food as with clothing, according as I shall be
able to serve you and deserve it.</p>

not, during the time of my life, have the right to withdraw from
your control or guardianship; but must remain during the days
of my life under your power or defense. Wherefore it is proper
that if either of us shall wish to withdraw himself from these
agreements, he shall pay &mdash;&mdash; shillings to the other party,
and this agreement shall remain unbroken.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p class="center">(2) <span class="smcap">The Benefice</span></p>

<p>The benefice, or grant of land to a vassal by a lord, by the Church,
or by the king, had its origin among the Franks in what were known
as the <i>precaria</i> of the Church. At the time of the Frankish settlement
in Gaul, it was quite customary for the Church to grant land to men in
answer to <i>preces</i> ("prayers," or requests), on condition that it might
be recalled at any time and that the temporary holder should be unable
to enforce any claims as against the owner. For the use of such land a
small rent in money, in produce, or in service was usually paid. This
form of tenure among the Franks was at first restricted to church
lands, but by the eighth century lay owners, even the king himself, had
come to employ it. The term <i>precarium</i> dropped out of use and all such
grants, by whomsoever made, came to be known as benefices ("benefits,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
or "favors"). The ordinary vassal might or might not once have
had land in his own name, but if he had such he was expected to give
over the ownership of it to his lord and receive it back as a benefice to
be used on certain prescribed conditions. In time it became common,
too, for lords to grant benefices out of their own lands to landless vassals.
A man could be a vassal without having a benefice, but rarely,
at least after the eighth century, could he have a benefice without entering
into the obligations of vassalage. Benefices were at first granted
by the Church with the understanding that they might be recalled at
any time; later they were granted by Church, kings, and seigniors for
life, or for a certain term of years; and finally, in the ninth and tenth
centuries, they came generally to be regarded as hereditary. By the
time the hereditary principle had been established, the name "fief"
(<i>feodum</i>, <i>feudum</i>&mdash;whence our word feudal) had supplanted the older
term "benefice." The tendency of the personal element of vassalage and
the territorial element of the benefice, or fief, to merge was very strong,
and by the tenth century nearly every vassal was also a fief-holder.
The following formulæ belong to the seventh century. The first (a) is
for the grant of lands to a church or monastery; the second (b) for
their return to the grantor as a <i>precarium</i>&mdash;or what was known a
century later as a benefice.</p>

which there my father left me at his death, and which, as against
my brothers, or as against my co-heirs, the lot legitimately

of Saint &mdash;&mdash;, to the monastery which is called &mdash;&mdash;,
where the Abbot &mdash;&mdash; is acknowledged to rule regularly
over God's flock. On these conditions: that so long as life
remains in my body, I shall receive from you as a benefice for
<span class="sidebar">Terms of

due payment I will make to you and your successors

shall have the same possessions for the days of his life, and shall
make the above-named payment; and if my children should
survive me, they shall have the same possessions during the days
of their lives and shall make the same payment; and if God shall
give me a son from a legitimate wife, he shall have the same
possessions for the days of his life only, after the death of whom
the same possessions, with all their improvements, shall return
to your hands to be held forever; and if it should be my chance
to beget sons from a legitimate marriage, these shall hold the
same possessions after my death, making the above-named
payment, during the time of their lives. If not, however, after
my death, without subterfuge of any kind, by right of your
authority, the same possessions shall revert to you, to be retained
forever. If any one, however (which I do not believe
will ever occur)&mdash;if I myself, or any other person&mdash;shall wish
to violate the firmness and validity of this grant, the order of

exercise our pastoral care, all your possessions which
you seemed to have in the district named, in the vill [village]

which, as against your brother or against &mdash;&mdash;, a co-heir,

afterwards, at your request, it has seemed proper
to us to cede to you the same possessions to be

at annual periods the due <i>census</i> [i.e., the rental] hence, that is

been begotten by you, immediately after your death, without
any harmful contention, the possessions shall revert to the rulers
or guardians of the above-named church, forever. Nor may any
one, either ourselves or our successors, be successful in a rash
attempt inordinately to destroy these agreements, but just as
the time has demanded in the present <i>precaria</i>, may that be
sure to endure unchanged which we, with the consent of our

<div class="intro">
<p class="center">(3) <span class="smcap">The Immunity</span></p>

<p>The most important element in the governmental phase of feudalism
was what was known as the immunity. In Roman law immunity
meant exemption from taxes and public services and belonged especially
to the lands owned personally by the emperors. Such exemptions
were, however, sometimes allowed to the lands of imperial officers
and of men in certain professions, and in later times to the lands held
by the Church. How closely this Roman immunity was connected
with the feudal immunity of the Middle Ages is not clear. Doubtless
the institution survived in Gaul, especially on church lands, long after
the Frankish conquest. It is best, however, to look upon the typical
Frankish immunity as of essentially independent origin. From the
time of Clovis, the kings were accustomed to make grants of the sort
to land-holding abbots and bishops, and by the time of Charlemagne
nearly all such prelates had been thus favored. But such grants were
not confined to ecclesiastics. Even in the seventh and eighth centuries
lay holders of royal benefices often received the privileges of the immunity
also. Speaking generally, the immunity exempted the lands
to which it applied from the jurisdiction of the local royal officials,
especially of the counts. The lands were supposed to be none the less
ultimately subject to the royal authority, but by the grant of immunity
the sovereign took their financial and judicial administration from the
counts, who would ordinarily have charge, and gave it to the holders of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
the lands. The counts were forbidden to enter the specified territories to
collect taxes or fines, hold courts, and sometimes even to arrange for
military service. The layman, or the bishop, or the abbot, who held
the lands performed these services and was responsible only to the
crown for them. The king's chief object in granting the immunity was
to reward or win the support of the grantees and to curtail the authority
of his local representatives, who in many cases threatened to become
too powerful for the good of the state; but by every such grant
the sovereign really lost some of his own power, and this practice came
to be in no small measure responsible for the weakness of monarchy in
feudal times.</p>

<p>The first of the extracts below (a) is a seventh-century formula for
the grant of an immunity by the king to a bishop. The second (b)
is a grant made by Charlemagne, in 779, confirming an old immunity
enjoyed by the monastery at Châlons-sur-Saône.</p>

<p>We believe that we give our royal authority its full splendor

aid of God, we give a written assurance of the continuance of
these favors. We wish, then, to make known that at the request
of a prelate, lord of &mdash;&mdash; [the estate named] and bishop
of &mdash;&mdash; [the church named], we have accorded to him, for
the sake of our eternal salvation, the following benefits: that in
the domains of the bishop's church, both those which it possesses
<span class="sidebar">A formula for

to-day and those which by God's grace it may
later acquire, no public official shall be permitted
to enter, either to hold courts or to exact fines,
on any account; but let these prerogatives be vested in full in
the bishop and his successors. We ordain therefore that neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
you nor your subordinates,<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> nor those who come after you, nor
any person endowed with a public office, shall ever enter the
domains of that church, in whatever part of our kingdom they
may be situated, either to hold trials or to collect fines. All the
taxes and other revenues which the royal treasury has a right to
demand from the people on the lands of the said church, whether
they be freemen or slaves, Romans or barbarians, we now bestow
on the said church for our future salvation, to be used by the
officials of the church forever for the best interests of the church.</p>

<p>Charles, by the grace of God King of the Franks and Lombards
and Patrician of the Romans, to all having charge of our
affairs, both present and to come:</p>

<p>By the help of the Lord, who has raised us to the throne of
this kingdom, it is the chief duty of our clemency to lend a
gracious ear to the need of all, and especially ought we devoutly
to regard that which we are persuaded has been granted by preceding
kings to church foundations for the saving of souls, and
not to deny fitting benefits, in order that we may deserve to be
partakers of the reward, but to confirm them in still greater
security.</p>

<p>Now the illustrious Hubert, bishop and ruler of the church of
St. Marcellus, which lies below the citadel of Châlons,<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> where the
<span class="sidebar">The old immunity
enjoyed
by the
monastery at
Châlons</span>
precious martyr of the Lord himself rests in the
body, has brought it to the attention of our
Highness that the kings who preceded us, or
our lord and father of blessed memory, Pepin, the
preceding king, had by their charters granted complete immunities
to that monastery, so that in the towns or on the lands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
belonging to it no public judge, nor any one with power of hearing
cases or exacting fines, or raising sureties, or obtaining
lodging or entertainment, or making requisitions of any kind,
should enter.</p>

<p>Moreover, the aforesaid bishop, Hubert, has presented the
original charters of former kings, together with the confirmations
of them, to be read by us, and declares the same favors to
be preserved to the present day; but desiring the confirmation
of our clemency, he prays that our authority may confirm this
grant anew to the monastery.</p>

<p>Wherefore, having inspected the said charters of former kings,
we command that neither you, nor your subordinates, nor your
successors, nor any person having judicial powers, shall presume
to enter into the villages which may at the present time be in
possession of that monastery, or which hereafter may have been
bestowed by God-fearing men [or may be about to be so bestowed].<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
<span class="sidebar"><b>The immunity

Let no public officer enter for the hearing of cases,
or for exacting fines, or procuring sureties, or
obtaining lodging or entertainment, or making
any requisitions; but in full immunity, even as the favor of former
kings has been continued down to the present day, so in the
future also shall it, through our authority, remain undiminished.
And if in times past, through any negligence of abbots, or luke-warmness
of rulers, or the presumption of public officers, anything
has been changed or taken away, removed or withdrawn,
from these immunities, let it, by our authority and favor, be
restored. And, further, let neither you nor your subordinates
presume to infringe upon or violate what we have granted.</p>

the indulgence of the good or by the favor of pious Christians or
kings, who shall have presumed to infringe upon or violate these

immunities, let him be punished with a fine of six
hundred <i>solidi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> two parts to go to the library of
this monastery, and the third part to be paid into our treasury,
so that impious men may not rejoice in violating that which
our ancestors, or good Christians, may have conceded or granted.
And whatever our treasury may have had a right to expect from
this source shall go to the profit of the men of this church of
St. Marcellus the martyr, to the better establishment of our
kingdom and the good of those who shall succeed us.</p>

<p>And that this decree may firmly endure we have ordered it to
be confirmed with our own hand under our seal.</p>

<h4>35. The Granting of Fiefs</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The most obvious feature of feudalism was a peculiar divided tenure
of land under which the title was vested in one person and the use in
another. The territorial unit was the fief, which in extent might be
but a few acres, a whole county, or even a vast region like Normandy
or Burgundy. Fiefs were granted to vassals by contracts which bound
both grantor and grantee to certain specific obligations. The two
extracts below are examples of the records of such feudal grants,
bearing the dates 1167 and 1200 respectively. It should be remembered,
however, that fiefs need not necessarily be land. Offices, payments
of money, rights to collect tolls, and many other valuable things
might be given by one man to another as fiefs in just the same way
that land was given. Du Cange, in his <i>Glossarium Mediæ et Infimæ
Latinitatis</i>, mentions eighty-eight different kinds of fiefs, and it has
been said that this does not represent more than one-fourth of the total
number. Nevertheless, the typical fief consisted of land. The term
might therefore be defined in general as the land for which the vassal,
or hereditary possessor, rendered to the lord, or hereditary proprietor,
services of a special character which were considered honorable, such
as military aid and attendance at courts.

<h4>36. The Ceremonies of Homage and Fealty</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The personal relation between lord and vassal was established by
the double ceremony of homage and fealty. Homage was the act by
which the vassal made himself the man (<i>homo</i>) of the lord, while fealty
was the oath of fidelity to the obligations which must ordinarily be
assumed by such a man. The two were really distinct, though because
they almost invariably went together they finally became confounded in
the popular mind. The details of the ceremonies varied much in different
times and places, but, in general, when homage was to be performed,
the prospective vassal presented himself before his future seigneur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
bareheaded and without arms; knelt, placed his hands in those of the
seigneur, and declared himself his man; then he was kissed by the seigneur
and lifted to his feet. In the act of fealty, the vassal placed his hand
upon sacred relics, or upon the Bible, and swore eternal faithfulness to
his seigneur. The so-called "act of investiture" generally followed, the
seigneur handing over to the vassal a bit of turf, a stick, or some other
object symbolizing the transfer of the usufruct of the property in question.
The whole process was merely a mode of establishing a binding
contract between the two parties. Below we have: (<i>a</i>) a mediæval
definition of homage, taken from the customary law of Normandy;
(<i>b</i>) an explanation of fealty, given in an old English law-book; (<i>c</i>) a
French chronicler's account of the rendering of homage and fealty to
the count of Flanders in the year 1127; and (<i>d</i>) a set of laws governing
homage and fealty, written down in a compilation of the ordinances
of Saint Louis (king of France, 1226-1270), but doubtless showing substantially
the practice in France for a long time before King Louis's day.</p>

<p>Homage is a pledge to keep faith in respect to matters that are
right and necessary, and to give counsel and aid. He who
<span class="sidebar">A Norman

of homage</span>
would do homage ought to place his hands between
those of the man who is to be his lord, and
speak these words: "I become your man, to keep
faith with you against all others, saving my allegiance to the
duke of Normandy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>And when a free tenant shall swear fealty to his lord, let him
place his right hand on the book<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and speak thus: "Hear thou
this, my lord, that I will be faithful and loyal to you and will
keep my pledges to you for the lands which I claim to hold of
<span class="sidebar">The oath
of fealty</span>
you, and that I will loyally perform for you the
services specified, so help me God and the saints."
Then he shall kiss the book; but he shall not kneel when he
swears fealty, nor take so humble a posture as is required in
homage.</p>

<p class="center">(c)</p>

<p>Through the whole remaining part of the day those who had
been previously enfeoffed by the most pious count Charles, did
homage to the count,<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> taking up now again their fiefs and offices
and whatever they had before rightfully and legitimately obtained.
On Thursday, the seventh of April, homages were again
made to the count, being completed in the following order of
faith and security:</p>

<p>First they did their homage thus. The count asked if he was
willing to become completely his man, and the other replied,
<span class="sidebar">The rendering
of homage and
fealty to the
count of Flanders</span>
"I am willing"; and with clasped hands, surrounded
by the hands of the count, they were
bound together by a kiss. Secondly, he who had
done homage gave his fealty to the representative
of the count in these words, "I promise on my faith that I will
in future be faithful to Count William, and will observe my
homage to him completely, against all persons, in good faith and
without deceit." Thirdly, he took his oath to this upon the
relics of the saints. Afterwards, with a little rod which the count
held in his hand, he gave investitures to all who by this agreement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
had given their security and homage and accompanying
oath.</p>

<p class="center">(d)</p>

<p>If any one would hold from a lord in fee, he ought to seek his
lord within forty days. And if he does not do it within forty days,
the lord may and ought to seize his fief for default of homage,
and the things which are found there he should seize without
compensation; and yet the vassal should be obliged to pay to
his lord the redemption.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> When any one wishes to enter into
the fealty of a lord, he ought to seek him, as we have said above,
and should speak as follows: "Sir, I request you, as my lord, to
<span class="sidebar">An ordinance
of St. Louis on
homage and
fealty</span>
put me in your fealty and in your homage for
such and such a thing situated in your fief, which
I have bought." And he ought to say from what
man, and this one ought to be present and in the fealty of the
lord;<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> and whether it is by purchase or by escheat<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> or by inheritance
he ought to explain; and with his hands joined, to
speak as follows: "Sir, I become your man and promise to you
fealty for the future as my lord, towards all men who may live
or die, rendering to you such service as the fief requires, making
to you your relief as you are the lord." And he ought to say
whether for guardianship,<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> or as an escheat, or as an inheritance,
or as a purchase.</p>

<p>The lord should immediately reply to him: "And I receive
you and take you as my man, and give you this kiss as a sign
of faith, saving my right and that of others," according to the
usage of the various districts.

<h4>37. The Mutual Obligations of Lords and Vassals</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The feudal relation was essentially one of contract involving reciprocal
relations between lord and vassal. In the following letter, written
in the year 1020 by Bishop Fulbert of Chartres<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> to the duke of Aquitaine,
we find laid down the general principles which ought to govern
the discharge of these mutual obligations. It is affirmed that there
were six things that no loyal vassal could do, and these are enumerated
and explained. Then comes the significant statement that these
negative duties must be supplemented with positive acts for the service
and support of the lord. What some of these acts were will appear in
the extracts in §<a href="#S38">38</a>. Bishop Fulbert points out also that the lord is
himself bound by feudal law not to do things detrimental to the safety,
honor, or prosperity of his vassal. The letter is an admirable statement
of the spirit of the feudal system at its best. Already by 1020 a
considerable body of feudal customs having the force of law had come
into existence and it appears that Fulbert had made these customs the
subject of some special study before answering the questions addressed
to him by Duke William.</p>
</div>

<p class="source">Source&mdash;Text in Martin Bouquet, <i>Recueil des Historiens des Gaules et de la
France</i> ["Collection of the Historians of Gaul and of France"],
Vol. X., p. 463.</p>

<p>To William, most illustrious duke of the Aquitanians, Bishop
Fulbert, the favor of his prayers:</p>

<p>Requested to write something regarding the character of
fealty, I have set down briefly for you, on the authority of the
books, the following things. He who takes the oath of fealty to
<span class="sidebar">What the vassal
owes the
lord</span>
his lord ought always to keep in mind these six
things: what is harmless, safe, honorable, useful,
easy, and practicable.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> <i>Harmless</i>, which means
that he ought not to injure his lord in his body; <i>safe</i>, that he
should not injure him by betraying his confidence or the defenses
upon which he depends for security; <i>honorable</i>, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
should not injure him in his justice, or in other matters that relate
to his honor; <i>useful</i>, that he should not injure him in his
property; <i>easy</i>, that he should not make difficult that which his
lord can do easily; and <i>practicable</i>, that he should not make
impossible for the lord that which is possible.</p>

<p>However, while it is proper that the faithful vassal avoid these
injuries, it is not for doing this alone that he deserves his holding:
for it is not enough to refrain from wrongdoing, unless that
which is good is done also. It remains, therefore, that in the
same six things referred to above he should faithfully advise and
aid his lord, if he wishes to be regarded as worthy of his benefice
and to be safe concerning the fealty which he has sworn.</p>

<p>The lord also ought to act toward his faithful vassal in the
same manner in all these things. And if he fails to do this, he
<span class="sidebar">The obligations
of the
lord</span>
will be rightfully regarded as guilty of bad faith,
just as the former, if he should be found shirking,
or willing to shirk, his obligations would be
perfidious and perjured.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>I should have written to you at greater length had I not been
busy with many other matters, including the rebuilding of our
city and church, which were recently completely destroyed by
a terrible fire. Though for a time we could not think of anything
but this disaster, yet now, by the hope of God's comfort,
and of yours also, we breathe more freely again.</p>

<h4><a name="S38" id="S38"></a>38. Some of the More Important Rights of the Lord</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The obligations of vassals to lords outlined in the preceding selection
were mainly of a moral character&mdash;such as naturally grew out of the
general idea of loyalty and fidelity to a benefactor. They were largely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
negative and were rather vague and indefinite. So far as they went,
they were binding upon lords and vassals alike. There were, however,
several very definite and practical rights which the lords possessed with
respect to the property and persons of their dependents. Some of these
were of a financial character, some were judicial, and others were
military. Five of the most important are illustrated by the passages
given below.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>a</i>) <span class="smcap">Aids</span></p>

<p>Under the feudal system the idea prevailed that the vassal's purse
as well as his body was to be at the lord's service. Originally the
right to draw upon his vassals for money was exercised by the lord
whenever he desired, but by custom this ill-defined power gradually
became limited to three sorts of occasions when the need of money
was likely to be especially urgent, i.e., when the eldest son was knighted,
when the eldest daughter was married, and when the lord was to be
ransomed from captivity. In the era of the crusades, the starting of
the lord on an expedition to the Holy Land was generally regarded as
another emergency in which an aid might rightfully be demanded.
The following extract from the old customary law of Normandy represents
the practice in nearly all feudal Europe.</p>
</div>

<p class="source">Source&mdash;<i>L'Ancienne Coutume de Normandie</i>, Chap. 35.</p>

<p>In Normandy there are three chief aids. The first is to help
make the lord's eldest son a knight; the second is to marry his
eldest daughter; the third is to ransom the body of the lord
from prison when he shall be taken captive during a war for the
<span class="sidebar">The three
aids</span>
duke.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> By this it appears that the <i>aide de chevalerie</i>
[knighthood-aid] is due when the eldest son
of the lord is made a knight. The eldest son is he who has the
dignity of primogeniture.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> The <i>aide de mariage</i> [marriage-aid] is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
due when the eldest daughter is married. The <i>aide de rançon</i>
[ransom-aid] is due when it is necessary to deliver the lord from
the prisons of the enemies of the duke. These aids are paid in
some fiefs at the rate of half a relief, and in some at the rate of
a third.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<div class="intro">

<p class="center">(<i>b</i>) <span class="smcap">Military Service</span></p>

<p>From whatever point of view feudalism is regarded&mdash;whether as a
system of land tenure, as a form of social organization, or as a type of
government&mdash;the military element in it appears everywhere important.
The feudal period was the greatest era of war the civilized world has
ever known. Few people between the tenth and fourteenth centuries,
except in the peasant classes, were able to live out their lives entirely
in peace. Of greatest value to kings and feudal magnates, greater even
than money itself, was a goodly following of soldiers; hence the almost
universal requirement of military service by lords from their vassals.
Fiefs were not infrequently granted out for no other purpose than to
get the military service which their holders would owe. The amount
of such service varied greatly in different times and places, but the
following arrangement represents the most common practice.</p>
</div>

<p class="source">Source&mdash;<i>Les Établissements de Saint Louis</i>, Bk. I., Chap. 65. Text in Paul
Viollet's edition (Paris, 1881), Vol. II., pp. 95-96.</p>

<p>The baron and the vassals of the king ought to appear in his
army when they shall be summoned, and ought to serve at their
own expense for forty days and forty nights, with whatever number
of knights they owe.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> And he possesses the right to exact
<span class="sidebar">The conditions
of military service</span>
from them these services when he wishes and
when he has need of them. If, however, the king
shall wish to keep them more than forty days and
forty nights at their own expense, they need not remain unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
they desire.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> But if he shall wish to retain them at his cost for
the defense of the kingdom, they ought lawfully to remain.
But if he shall propose to lead them outside of the kingdom,
they need not go unless they are willing, for they have already
served their forty days and forty nights.</p>

<div class="intro">

<p class="center">(<i>c</i>) <span class="smcap">Wardship and Marriage</span></p>

<p>Very important among the special prerogatives of the feudal lord
was his right to manage, and enjoy the profits of, fiefs inherited by
minors. When a vassal died, leaving an heir who was under age, the
lord was charged with the care of the fief until the heir reached his or
her majority. On becoming of age, a young man was expected to take
control of his fief at once. But a young woman remained under wardship
until her marriage, though if she married under age she could get
possession of her fief immediately, just as she would had she waited
until older. The control of the marriage of heiresses was largely in the
hands of their lords, for obviously it was to the lord's interest that no
enemy of his, nor any shiftless person, should become the husband of
his ward. The lord could compel a female ward to marry and could
oblige her to accept as a husband one of the candidates whom he offered
her; but it was usually possible for the woman to purchase exemption
from this phase of his jurisdiction. After the thirteenth century the
right of wardship gradually declined in France, though it long continued
in England. The following extract from the customs of Normandy
sets forth the typical feudal law on the subject.</p>
</div>

<p class="source">Source&mdash;<i>L'Ancienne Coutume de Normandie</i>, Chap. 33.</p>

<p>Heirs should be placed in guardianship until they reach the
age of twenty years; and those who hold them as wards should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
give over to them all the fiefs which came under their control
by reason of wardship, provided they have not lost anything by
judicial process.... When the heirs pass out of the condition
of wardship, their lords shall not impose upon them any
reliefs for their fiefs, for the profits of wardship shall be reckoned
in place of the relief.</p>

<p>When a female ward reaches the proper age to marry, she
should be married by the advice and consent of her lord, and by
<span class="sidebar">The marriage
of a female
ward</span>
the advice and consent of her relatives and
friends, according as the nobility of her ancestry
and the value of her fief may require; and
upon her marriage the fief which has been held in guardianship
should be given over to her. A woman cannot be freed from
wardship except by marriage; and let it not be said that she is
of age until she is twenty years old. But if she be married at
the age at which it is allowable for a woman to marry, the fact of
her marriage makes her of age and delivers her fief from wardship.</p>

<p>The fiefs of those who are under wardship should be cared
for attentively by their lords, who are entitled to receive the
<span class="sidebar">The lord's obligation
to care
for the fief of
his ward</span>
produce and profits.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> And in this connection let
it be known that the lord ought to preserve in
their former condition the buildings, the manor-houses,
the forests and meadows, the gardens, the ponds, the
mills, the fisheries, and the other things of which he has the profits.
And he should not sell, destroy, or remove the woods, the houses,
or the trees.</p>

<div class="intro">
<p class="center">(<i>d</i>) <span class="smcap">Reliefs</span></p>

<p>A relief was a payment made to the lord by an heir before entering
upon possession of his fief. The history of reliefs goes back to the time
when benefices were not hereditary and when, if a son succeeded his
father in the usufruct of a piece of property, it was regarded as an unusual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
thing&mdash;a special favor on the part of the owner to be paid for by
the new tenant. Later, when fiefs had become almost everywhere
hereditary, the custom of requiring reliefs still survived. The amount
was at first arbitrary, being arranged by individual bargains; but in
every community, especially in France, the tendency was toward a fixed
custom regarding it. Below are given some brief extracts from English
Treasury records which show how men in England between the years
1140 and 1230 paid the king for the privilege of retaining the fiefs held
by their fathers.</p>

<div class="intro">
<p class="center">(<i>e</i>) <span class="smcap">Forfeiture</span></p>

<p>The lord's most effective means of compelling his vassals to discharge
their obligations was his right to take back their fiefs for breach
of feudal contract. Such a breach, or felony, as it was technically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
called, might consist in refusal to render military service or the required
aids, ignoring the sovereign authority of the lord, levying war against
the lord, dishonoring members of the lord's family, or, as in the case
below, refusing to obey the lord's summons to appear in court. In
practice the lords generally found it difficult to enforce the penalty of
forfeiture and after the thirteenth century the tendency was to substitute
money fines for dispossession, except in the most aggravated
cases. The following is an account of the condemnation of Arnold
Atton, a nobleman of south France, by the feudal court of Raymond,
count of Toulouse, in the year 1249. The penalty imposed was the
loss of the valuable château of Auvillars.</p>

<p>Raymond, by the grace of God count of Toulouse, marquis of
Provence, to the nobleman Arnold Atton, viscount of Lomagne,
greeting:</p>

<p>Let it be known to your nobility by the tenor of these presents
what has been done in the matter of the complaints which we
have made about you before the court of Agen; that you have
not taken the trouble to keep or fulfill the agreements sworn by
you to us, as is more fully contained in the instrument drawn up
there, sealed with our seal by the public notary; and that you
have refused contemptuously to appear before the said court for
the purpose of doing justice, and have otherwise committed
multiplied and great delinquencies against us. As your faults
<span class="sidebar">The court's
sentence upon
Arnold Atton</span>
have required, the aforesaid court of Agen has
unanimously and concordantly pronounced sentence
against you, and for these matters have
condemned you to hand over and restore to us the château of
Auvillars and all that land which you hold from us in fee, to be
had and held by us by right of the obligation by which you have
bound it to us for fulfilling and keeping the said agreements.</p>

<p>Likewise it has declared that we are to be put into possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
of the said land and that it is to be handed over to us, on account
of your contumacy, because you have not been willing to appear
before the same court on the days which were assigned to you.
Moreover, it has declared that you shall be held and required
to restore the said land in whatsoever way we wish to receive it,
with few or many, in peace or in anger, in our own person, by
right of lordship. Likewise it has declared that you shall restore
to us all the expenses which we have incurred, or the court
itself has incurred, on those days which were assigned to you,
or because of those days, and has condemned you to repay these
to us.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, it has declared that the nobleman Gerald d'Armagnac,
whom you hold captive, you shall liberate, and deliver him
free to us. We demand, moreover, by right of our lordship that
you liberate him.</p>

<p>We call, therefore, upon your discretion in this matter, strictly
enjoining you and commanding that you obey the aforesaid
sentences in all things and fulfill them in all respects and in no
way delay the execution of them.</p>

<h4>39. The Peace and the Truce of God</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>War rather than peace was the normal condition of feudal society.
Peasants were expected to settle their disputes in the courts of law,
but lords and seigneurs possessed a legal right to make war upon their
enemies and were usually not loath to exercise it. Private warfare was
indeed so common that it all the time threatened seriously the lives and
property of the masses of the people and added heavily to the afflictions
which flood, drought, famine, and pestilence brought repeatedly
upon them. The first determined efforts to limit, if not to abolish,
the ravages of private war were made by the Church, partly because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
the Church itself often suffered by reason of them, partly because its
ideal was that of peace and security, and partly because it recognized
its duty as the protector of the poor and oppressed. Late in the tenth
century, under the influence of the Cluniacs [see <a href="#Page_245">p. 245</a>], the clergy of
France, both secular and regular, began in their councils to promulgate
decrees which were intended to establish what was known as the Peace
of God. These decrees, which were enacted by so many councils between
989 and 1050 that they came to cover pretty nearly all France, proclaimed
generally that any one who should use violence toward women, peasants,
merchants, or members of the clergy should be excommunicated. The
principle was to exempt certain classes of people from the operations
of war and violence, even though the rest of the population should
continue to fight among themselves. It must be said that these decrees,
though enacted again and again, had often little apparent effect.</p>

<p>Effort was then made in another direction. From about 1027 the
councils began to proclaim what was known as the Truce of God,
sometimes alone and sometimes in connection with the Peace. The
purport of the Truce of God was that all men should abstain from warfare
and violence during a certain portion of each week, and during
specified church festivals and holy seasons. At first only Sunday was
thus designated; then other days, until the time from Wednesday night
to Monday morning was all included; then extended periods, as Lent,
were added, until finally not more than eighty days remained of the
entire year on which private warfare was allowable. As one writer has
stated it, "the Peace of God was intended to protect certain classes
at all times and the Truce to protect all classes at certain times." It
was equally difficult to secure the acquiescence of the lawless nobles
in both, and though the efforts of the Church were by no means without
result, we are to think of private warfare as continuing quite common
until brought gradually to an end by the rise of strong monarchies,
by the turning of men to commerce and trade, and by the drawing off
of military energies into foreign and international wars.</p>

<p>The decree given below, which combines features of both the Peace
and the Truce, was issued by the Council of Toulouges (near Perpignan)
in 1041, or, as some scholars think, in 1065. Its substance was many
times reënacted, notably by the Council of Clermont, in 1095, upon the
occasion of the proclamation of the first Crusade. It should have procured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
about 240 days of peace in every year and reduced war to about
120 days, but, like the others, it was only indifferently observed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
THE NORMAN CONQUEST</h3>

<h4>40. The Battle of Hastings: the English and the Normans</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The Northmen, under the leadership of the renowned Rollo, got
their first permanent foothold in that important part of France since
known as Normandy in the year 911 [see <a href="#Page_171">p. 171</a>]. Almost from the
beginning the new county (later duchy) increased rapidly both in
territorial extent and in political influence. The Northmen, or Normans,
were a vigorous, ambitious, and on the whole very capable people,
and they needed only the polishing which peaceful contact with the
French could give to make them one of the most virile elements in the
population of western Europe. They gave up their old gods and accepted
Christianity, ceased to speak their own language and began the
use of French, and to a considerable extent became ordinary soldiers
and traders instead of the wild pirates their forefathers had been. The
spirit of unrest, however, and the love of adventure so deeply ingrained
in their natures did not die out, and we need not be surprised to learn
that they continued still to enjoy nothing quite so much as war, especially
if it involved hazardous expeditions across seas. Some went
to help the Christians of Spain against the Saracens; some went to aid
the Eastern emperors against the Turks; others went to Sicily and
southern Italy, where they conquered weak rulers and set up principalities
of their own; and finally, under the leadership of Duke William
the Bastard, in 1066, they entered upon the greatest undertaking of all,
i.e., the conquest of England and the establishment of a Norman
chieftain upon the throne of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom.</p>

<p>Duke William was one of the greatest and most ambitious feudal
lords of France&mdash;more powerful really than the French king himself.
He had overcome practically all opposition among his unruly vassals
in Normandy, and by 1066, when the death of King Edward the Confessor
occurred in England, he was ready to engage in great enterprises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
which gave promise of enhanced power and renown. He had long
cherished a claim to the English throne, and when he learned that in
utter disregard of this claim the English witan had chosen Harold,
son of the West Saxon Earl Godwin, to be Edward's successor, he prepared
to invade the island kingdom and force an acknowledgment of
what he pretended at least to believe were his rights. Briefly stated,
William claimed the English throne on the ground (1) that through his
wife Matilda, a descendant of Emma, Edward the Confessor's mother,
he was a nearer heir than was Harold, who was only the late king's
brother-in-law; (2) that on the occasion of a visit to England in 1051
Edward had promised him the inheritance; and (3) that Harold himself,
when some years before he had been shipwrecked on the coast of
Normandy, had sworn on sacred relics to help him gain the crown.
There is some doubt as to the actual facts in connection with both of
these last two points, but the truth is that all of William's claims taken
together were not worth much, since the recognized principle of the
English government was that the king should be chosen by the wisemen,
or witan. Harold had been so chosen and hence was in every way the
legitimate sovereign.</p>

<p>William, however, was determined to press his claims and, after
obtaining the blessing of the Pope (Alexander II.), he gathered
an army of perhaps 65,000 Normans and adventurers from all
parts of France and prepared a fleet of some 1,500 transports at the
mouth of the Dive to carry his troops across the Channel. September
28, 1066, the start was made and the following day the host landed
at Pevensey in Sussex. Friday, the 29th, Hastings was selected and
fortified to serve as headquarters. The English were taken at great disadvantage.
Only two days before the Normans crossed the Channel
Harold with all the troops he could muster had been engaged in a great
battle at Stamford Bridge, in Northumberland, with Harold Hardrada,
king of Norway, who was making an independent invasion. The English
had won the fight, but they were not in a position to meet the
Normans as they might otherwise have been. With admirable energy,
however, Harold marched his weary army southward to Senlac, a hill
near the town of Hastings, and there took up his position to await an
attack by the duke's army. The battle came on Saturday, October 14,
and after a very stubborn contest, in which Harold was slain, it resulted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
in a decisive victory for the Normans. Thereafter the conquest
of the entire kingdom, while by no means easy, was inevitable.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury, from whose <i>Chronicle of the Kings of England</i>
our account of the battle and of the two contending peoples is taken, was
a Benedictine monk, born of a Norman father and an English mother.
He lived about 1095-1150 and hence wrote somewhat over half a century
after the Conquest. While thus not strictly a contemporary, he
was a man of learning and discretion and there is every reason to believe
that he made his history as accurate as he was able, with the materials
at his command. His parentage must have enabled him to understand
both combatants in an unusual degree and, though his sympathies were
with the conquerors, we may take his characterizations of Saxon and
Norman alike to be at least fairly reliable. His <i>Chronicle</i> covers the
period 449-1135, and for the years after 1066 it is the fullest, most
carefully written, and most readable account of English affairs that we
have.</p>

[William of Malmesbury, "Chronicle of the Kings of England"],
Bk. III. Adapted from translation by John Sharpe (London,

<p>The courageous leaders mutually prepared for battle, each
according to his national custom. The English passed the night<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
without sleep, in drinking and singing, and in the morning proceeded
without delay against the enemy. All on foot, armed
with battle-axes, and covering themselves in front by joining
<span class="sidebar">How the English
prepared
for battle</span>
their shields, they formed an impenetrable body
which would assuredly have secured their safety
that day had not the Normans, by a pretended
flight, induced them to open their ranks, which until that time,
according to their custom, had been closely knit together.
King Harold himself, on foot, stood with his brothers near the
standard in order that, so long as all shared equal danger, none
could think of retreating. This same standard William sent,
after his victory, to the Pope. It was richly embroidered with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
gold and precious stones, and represented the figure of a man
fighting.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Normans passed the whole night in
confessing their sins, and received the communion of the Lord's
body in the morning. Their infantry, with bows and arrows,
formed the vanguard, while their cavalry, divided into wings,
<span class="sidebar">How the Normans
prepared</span>
was placed in the rear. The duke, with serene
countenance, declaring aloud that God would
favor his as being the righteous side, called for his arms; and
when, through the haste of his attendants, he had put on his
hauberk<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> the rear part before, he corrected the mistake with a
laugh, saying, "The power of my dukedom shall be turned into
a kingdom." Then starting the song of Roland,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> in order that
the warlike example of that hero might stimulate the soldiers,
and calling on God for assistance, the battle commenced on both
sides, and was fought with great ardor, neither side yielding
ground during the greater part of the day.</p>

<p>Observing this, William gave a signal to his troops, that,
pretending flight, they should withdraw from the field.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> By
means of this device the solid phalanx of the English opened for
the purpose of cutting down the fleeing enemy and thus brought
upon itself swift destruction; for the Normans, facing about,
<span class="sidebar">William's
strategem</span>
attacked them, thus disordered, and compelled
them to fly. In this manner, deceived by stratagem,
they met an honorable death in avenging their country;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
nor indeed were they at all without their own revenge, for, by
frequently making a stand, they slaughtered their pursuers in
heaps. Getting possession of a higher bit of ground, they drove
back the Normans, who in the heat of pursuit were struggling up
the slope, into the valley beneath, where, by hurling their javelins
and rolling down stones on them as they stood below, the
English easily destroyed them to a man. Besides, by a short
passage with which they were acquainted, they avoided a deep
ditch and trod underfoot such a multitude of their enemies in
that place that the heaps of bodies made the hollow level with
the plain. This alternating victory, first of one side and then
of the other, continued as long as Harold lived to check the retreat;
but when he fell, his brain pierced by an arrow, the flight
of the English ceased not until night.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>In the battle both leaders distinguished themselves by their
bravery. Harold, not content with the duties of a general and
with exhorting others, eagerly assumed himself the work of a
common soldier. He was constantly striking down the enemy
<span class="sidebar">The valor
of Harold</span>
at close quarters, so that no one could approach
him with impunity, for straightway both horse
and rider would be felled by a single blow. So it was at long
range, as I have said, that the enemy's deadly arrow brought
him to his death. One of the Norman soldiers gashed his thigh
with a sword, as he lay prostrate; for which shameful and cowardly
action he was branded with ignominy by William and
expelled from the army.</p>

<p>William, too, was equally ready to encourage his soldiers by
his voice and by his presence, and to be the first to rush forward
to attack the thickest of the foe. He was everywhere fierce and
furious. He lost three choice horses, which were that day killed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
under him. The dauntless spirit and vigor of the intrepid general,
however, still held out. Though often called back by the
<span class="sidebar">William's bravery
and ardor</span>
thoughtful remonstrance of his bodyguard, he
still persisted until approaching night crowned him
with complete victory. And no doubt the hand of God so protected
him that the enemy could draw no blood from his person,
though they aimed so many javelins at him.</p>

<p>This was a fatal day to England, and melancholy havoc was
wrought in our dear country during the change of its lords.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
For it had long before adopted the manners of the Angles, which
had indeed altered with the times; for in the first years of their
arrival they were barbarians in their look and manner, warlike
in their usages, heathen in their rites.</p>

<p>After embracing the faith of Christ, by degrees and, in process
of time, in consequence of the peace which they enjoyed, they
consigned warfare to a secondary place and gave their whole
attention to religion. I am not speaking of the poor, the meanness
of whose fortune often restrains them from overstepping
<span class="sidebar">Religious zeal
of the Saxons
before the Conquest</span>
the bounds of justice; I omit, too, men of ecclesiastical
rank, whom sometimes respect for their
profession and sometimes the fear of shame
suffers not to deviate from the true path; I speak
of princes, who from the greatness of their power might have
full liberty to indulge in pleasure. Some of these in their own
country, and others at Rome, changing their habit, obtained a
heavenly kingdom and a saintly fellowship. Many others during
their whole lives devoted themselves in outward appearance
to worldly affairs, but in order that they might expend their
treasures on the poor or divide them amongst monasteries.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>What shall I say of the multitudes of bishops, hermits, and
abbots? Does not the whole island blaze with such numerous
relics of its own people that you can scarcely pass a village of
any consequence without hearing the name of some new saint?
And of how many more has all remembrance perished through
the want of records?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the attention to literature and religion had
gradually decreased for several years before the arrival of the
Normans. The clergy, contented with a little confused learning,
could scarcely stammer out the words of the sacraments;
and a person who understood grammar was an object of wonder
and astonishment.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The monks mocked the rule of their order
<span class="sidebar">Recent decline
of learning and
religion</span>
by fine vestments and the use of every kind of
food. The nobility, given up to luxury and
wantonness, went not to church in the morning
after the manner of Christians, but merely, in a careless manner,
heard matins and masses from a hurrying priest in their chambers,
amid the blandishments of their wives. The community,
left unprotected, became a prey to the most powerful, who
amassed fortunes, either by seizing on their property or by selling
their persons into foreign countries; although it is characteristic
of this people to be more inclined to reveling than to the
accumulation of wealth.</p>

<p>Drinking in parties was an universal practice, in which occupation
they passed entire nights as well as days. They consumed
their whole substance in mean and despicable houses,
unlike the Normans and French, who live frugally in noble and
splendid mansions. The vices attendant on drunkenness, which
enervate the human mind, followed; hence it came about that
when they resisted William, with more rashness and precipitate
fury than military skill, they doomed themselves and their
country to slavery by a single, and that an easy, victory.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
nothing is less effective than rashness; and what begins with
violence quickly ceases or is repelled. The English at that time
<span class="sidebar">The English
people described</span>
wore short garments, reaching to the mid-knee;
they had their hair cropped, their beards shaven,
their arms laden with golden bracelets, their skin
adorned with tattooed designs. They were accustomed to eat
until they became surfeited, and to drink until they were sick.
These latter qualities they imparted to their conquerors; as for
the rest, they adopted their manners. I would not, however,
have these bad characteristics ascribed to the English universally;
I know that many of the clergy at that day trod the path
of sanctity by a blameless life. I know that many of the laity,
of all ranks and conditions, in this nation were well-pleasing to
God. Be injustice far from this account; the accusation does not
involve the whole, indiscriminately. But as in peace the mercy
of God often cherishes the bad and the good together, so, equally,
does His severity sometimes include them both in captivity.</p>

<p>The Normans&mdash;that I may speak of them also&mdash;were at that
time, and are even now, exceedingly particular in their dress
and delicate in their food, but not so to excess. They are a race
accustomed to war, and can hardly live without it; fierce in rushing
against the enemy, and, where force fails to succeed, ready
<span class="sidebar">A description
of the Normans</span>
to use stratagem or to corrupt by bribery. As
I have said, they live in spacious houses with
economy, envy their superiors, wish to excel their
equals, and plunder their subjects, though they defend them
from others; they are faithful to their lords, though a slight
offense alienates them. They weigh treachery by its chance of
success, and change their sentiments for money. The most
hospitable, however, of all nations, they esteem strangers worthy
of equal honor with themselves; they also intermarry with their
vassals. They revived, by their arrival, the rule of religion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
which had everywhere grown lifeless in England.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> You might
see churches rise in every village, and monasteries in the towns
and cities, built after a style unknown before; you might behold
the country flourishing with renewed rites; so that each wealthy
man accounted that day lost to him which he had neglected to
signalize by some beneficent act.</p>

<h4>41. William the Conqueror as Man and as King</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In the following passage, taken from the Saxon Chronicle, we have
an interesting summary of the character of the Conqueror and of his
conduct as king of England. Both the good and bad sides of the
picture are clearly brought out and perhaps it is not quite easy to say
which is given the greater prominence. On the one hand there is
William's devotion to the Church, his establishment of peace and order,
his mildness in dealing with all but those who had antagonized him,
and the virtue of his personal life; on the other is his severity, rapacity,
and pride, his heavy taxes and his harsh forest laws. As one writer
says, "the Conquest was bad as well as good for England; but the
harm was only temporary, the good permanent." It is greatly to the
credit of the English chronicler that he was able to deal so fairly with
the character of one whom he had not a few patriotic reasons for maligning.</p>
</div>

<p class="source">Source&mdash;<i>The Saxon Chronicle.</i> Translated by J. A. Giles (London, 1847),
pp. 461-462.</p>

<p>If any one would know what manner of man King William
was, the glory that he obtained, and of how many lands he was
lord, then will we describe him as we have known him, we who
have looked upon him and who once lived at his court. This
King William, of whom we are speaking, was a very wise and a
great man, and more honored and more powerful than any of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
his predecessors. He was mild to those good men who loved
God, but severe beyond measure towards those who withstood
<span class="sidebar">William's
religious zeal</span>
his will. He founded a noble monastery on the
spot where God permitted him to conquer England,
and he established monks in it, and he made it very rich.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
In his days the great monastery at Canterbury was built,<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> and
many others also throughout England; moreover, this land was
filled with monks who lived after the rule of St. Benedict; and
such was the state of religion in his days that all who would
might observe that which was prescribed by their respective
orders.</p>

<p>King William was also held in much reverence. He wore his
crown three times every year when he was in England: at Easter
he wore it at Winchester,<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> at Pentecost at Westminster,<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and at
Christmas at Gloucester.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> And at these times all the men of
<span class="sidebar">His strong
government</span>
England were with him, archbishops, bishops,
abbots and earls, thanes<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> and knights.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> So also
was he a very stern and a wrathful man, so that none durst
do anything against his will, and he kept in prison those earls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
who acted against his pleasure. He removed bishops from their
sees<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> and abbots from their offices, and he imprisoned thanes,
and at length he spared not his own brother Odo. This Odo was
a very powerful bishop in Normandy. His see was that of
Bayeux,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> and he was foremost to serve the king. He had an
earldom in England, and when William was in Normandy he
[Odo] was the first man in this country [England], and him did
William cast into prison.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>Amongst other things, the good order that William established
is not to be forgotten. It was such that any man, who was himself
aught, might travel over the kingdom with a bosom full of
gold unmolested; and no man durst kill another, however great
the injury he might have received from him. He reigned over
England, and being sharp-sighted to his own interest, he surveyed
the kingdom so thoroughly that there was not a single
<span class="sidebar">The extent of
his power</span>
hide of land throughout the whole of which he
knew not the possessor, and how much it was
worth, and this he afterwards entered in his register.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> The land
of the Britons [Wales] was under his sway, and he built castles
therein; moreover he had full dominion over the Isle of Man;<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
Scotland also was subject to him, from his great strength; the
land of Normandy was his by inheritance, and he possessed the
earldom of Maine;<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and had he lived two years longer, he would
have subdued Ireland by his prowess, and that without a battle.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>Truly there was much trouble in these times, and very great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
distress. He caused castles to be built and oppressed the poor.
The king was also of great sternness, and he took from his subjects
many marks of gold, and many hundred pounds of silver,
and this, either with or without right, and with little need. He
was given to avarice, and greedily loved gain.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> He made large
forests for the deer, and enacted laws therewith, so that whoever
killed a hart or a hind should be blinded. As he forbade killing
<span class="sidebar">His faults
as a ruler</span>
the deer, so also the boars; and he loved the tall
stags as if he were their father. He also commanded
concerning the hares, that they should go free.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The
rich complained and the poor murmured, but he was so sturdy
that he recked nought of them; they must will all that the king
willed, if they would live, or would keep their lands, or would hold
their possessions, or would be maintained in their rights. Alas
that any man should so exalt himself, and carry himself in his
pride over all! May Almighty God show mercy to his soul, and
grant him the forgiveness of his sins! We have written concerning
him these things, both good and bad, that virtuous men
may follow after the good, and wholly avoid the evil, and
may go in the way that leadeth to the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.<br />
THE MONASTIC REFORMATION OF THE TENTH, ELEVENTH,
AND TWELFTH CENTURIES</h3>

<h4>42. The Foundation Charter of the Monastery of Cluny (910)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Throughout the earlier Middle Ages the Benedictine Rule [see
<a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a>] was the code under which were governed practically all the
monastic establishments of western Europe. There was a natural
tendency, however, for the severe and exacting features of the Rule to
be softened considerably in actual practice. As one writer puts it, "the
excessive abstinence and many other of the mechanical observances of
the rule were soon found to have little real utility when simply enforced
by a rule, and not practiced willingly for the sake of self-discipline."
The obligation of manual labor, for example, was frequently dispensed
with in order that the monks might occupy themselves with the studies
for which the Benedictines have always been famous. Too often such
relaxation was but a pretext for the indulgence of idleness or vice.
The disrepute into which such tendencies brought the monastics in
the tenth and eleventh centuries gave rise to numerous attempts to
revive the primitive discipline, the most notable of which was the so-called
"Cluniac movement."</p>

<p>The monastery of Cluny, on the borders of Aquitaine and Burgundy,
was established under the terms of a charter issued by William the
Pious, duke of Aquitaine and count of Auvergne, September 11, 910.
The conditions of its foundation, set forth in the text of the charter
given below, were in many ways typical. The history of the monastery
was, however, quite exceptional. During the invasions and civil wars
of the latter half of the ninth century, many of the monasteries of western
Europe had fallen under the control of unscrupulous laymen who
used them mainly to satisfy their greed or ambition, and in consequence
by the time that Cluny was founded the standard of monastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
life and service had been seriously impaired. The monks had grown
worldly, education was neglected, and religious services had become
empty formalities. Powerful nobles used their positions of advantage
to influence, and often to dictate, the election of bishops and abbots,
and the men thus elected were likely enough to be unworthy of their
offices in both character and ability. The charter of the Cluny monastery,
however, expressly provided that the abbot should be chosen by
canonical election, i.e., by the monks, and without any sort of outside
interference. The life of the monastery was to be regulated by the
Benedictine Rule, though with rather less stress on manual labor and
rather more on religious services and literary employment. Cluny,
indeed, soon came to be one of the principal centers of learning in western
Europe, as well as perhaps the greatest administrator of charity.</p>

<p>Another notable achievement of Cluny was the building up of the so-called
"Cluny Congregation." Hitherto it had been customary for monasteries
to be entirely independent of one another, even when founded
by monks sent out from a parent establishment. Cluny, however, kept
under the control of her own abbot all monasteries founded by her
agents and made the priors of these monasteries directly responsible
to him. Many outside abbeys were drawn into the new system, so that
by the middle of the twelfth century the Cluny congregation was comprised
of more than two thousand monasteries, all working harmoniously
under a single abbot-general. The majority of these were in France, but
there were many also in Spain, Italy, Poland, Germany, and England.
It was the Cluny monks who gave the Pope his chief support in the
struggle to free the Church from lay investiture and simony and to
enforce the ideal of a celibate clergy. This movement for reform may
properly be said, indeed, to have originated with the Cluniacs and to
have been taken up only later by the popes, chiefly by Gregory VII.
By the end of the eleventh century Cluniac discipline had begun to
grow lax and conditions were gradually shaped for another wave of
monastic reform, which came with the establishment of the Carthusians
(in 1084) and of the Cistercians (in 1098).

<p>To all who think wisely it is evident that the providence of
God has made it possible for rich men, by using well their temporal
possessions, to be able to merit eternal rewards....
I, William, count and duke, after diligent reflection, and desiring
to provide for my own safety while there is still time, have
decided that it is advisable, indeed absolutely necessary, that
<span class="sidebar">Motives
for Duke
William's
benefaction</span>
from the possessions which God has given me I
should give some portion for the good of my soul.
I do this, indeed, in order that I who have thus increased
in wealth may not at the last be accused of having spent all
in caring for my body, but rather may rejoice, when fate at length
shall snatch all things away, in having preserved something for
myself. I cannot do better than follow the precepts of Christ
and make His poor my friends. That my gift may be durable and
not transitory I will support at my own expense a congregation
of monks. And I hope that I shall receive the reward of the
righteous because I have received those whom I believe to be
righteous and who despise the world, although I myself am not
able to despise all things.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>Therefore be it known to all who live in the unity of the faith
and who await the mercy of Christ, and to those who shall succeed
them and who shall continue to exist until the end of the
world, that, for the love of God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
I hand over from my own rule to the holy apostles, namely,
<span class="sidebar">The land and
other property
ceded</span>
Peter and Paul, the possessions over which I hold
sway&mdash;the town of Cluny, with the court and
demesne manor, and the church in honor of St.
Mary, the mother of God, and of St. Peter, the prince of the
apostles, together with all the things pertaining to it, the villas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
the chapels, the serfs of both sexes, the vines, the fields, the
meadows, the woods, the waters and their outlets, the mills, the
incomes and revenues, what is cultivated and what is not, all
without reserve. These things are situated in or about the
county of Mâcon<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>, each one marked off by definite bounds. I
give, moreover, all these things to the aforesaid apostles&mdash;I,
William, and my wife Ingelberga&mdash;first for the love of God; then
for the soul of my lord King Odo, of my father and my mother;
for myself and my wife,&mdash;for the salvation, namely, of our souls
and bodies; and not least, for that of Ava, who left me these
things in her will; for the souls also of our brothers and sisters
and nephews, and of all our relatives of both sexes; for our faithful
ones who adhere to our service; for the advancement, also,
and integrity of the Catholic religion. Finally, since all of us
Christians are held together by one bond of love and faith, let
this donation be for all&mdash;for the orthodox, namely, of past,
present, or future times.</p>

<p>I give these things, moreover, with this understanding, that
in Cluny a monastery shall be constructed in honor of the holy
apostles Peter and Paul, and that there the monks shall congregate
and live according to the rule of St. Benedict, and that
<span class="sidebar">A monastery
to be established.</span>
they shall possess and make use of these same
things for all time. In such wise, however, that
the venerable house of prayer which is there shall
be faithfully frequented with vows and supplications, and that
heavenly conversations shall be sought after with all desire and
with the deepest ardor; and also that there shall be diligently
directed to God prayers and exhortations, as well for me as for
all, according to the order in which mention has been made of
them above. And let the monks themselves, together with all
aforesaid possessions, be under the power and dominion of the
abbot Berno, who, as long as he shall live, shall preside over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
them regularly according to his knowledge and ability.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> But
after his death, those same monks shall have power and permission
<span class="sidebar">Election of
abbots to be
"canonical"</span>
to elect any one of their order whom
they please as abbot and rector, following the will
of God and the rule promulgated by St. Benedict&mdash;in
such wise that neither by the intervention of our own or
of any other power may they be impeded from making a purely canonical
election. Every five years, moreover, the aforesaid monks
shall pay to the church of the apostles at Rome ten shillings to
supply them with lights; and they shall have the protection of
those same apostles and the defense of the Roman pontiff; and
those monks may, with their whole heart and soul, according to
their ability and knowledge, build up the aforesaid place.</p>

<p>We will, further, that in our times and in those of our successors,
according as the opportunities and possibilities of that
<span class="sidebar">Works of charity
enjoined</span>
place shall allow, there shall daily, with the greatest
zeal, be performed works of mercy towards
the poor, the needy, strangers, and pilgrims.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> It has pleased us
also to insert in this document that, from this day, those same
monks there congregated shall be subject neither to our yoke,
nor to that of our relatives, nor to the sway of the royal might,
nor to that of any earthly power. And, through God and all His
saints, and by the awful day of judgment, I warn and admonish
that no one of the secular princes, no count, no bishop, not even
the pontiff of the aforesaid Roman see, shall invade the property
of these servants of God, or alienate it, or diminish it, or exchange
it, or give it as a benefice to any one, or set up any prelate
over them against their will.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<h4>43. The Early Career of St. Bernard and the Founding of Clairvaux</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The most important individual who had part in the twelfth century
movement for monastic reform was unquestionably St. Bernard, of
whom indeed it has been said with reason that for a quarter of a century
there was no more influential man in Europe. Born in 1091, he came
upon the scene when times were ripe for great deeds and great careers,
whether with the crusading hosts in the East or in the vexed swirl of
secular and ecclesiastical affairs in the West. Particularly were the
times ripe for a great preacher and reformer&mdash;one who could avail himself
of the fresh zeal of the crusading period and turn a portion of it to
the regeneration of the corrupt and sluggish spiritual life which in far
too great a measure had crept in to replace the earlier purity and devotion
of the clergy. The need of reform was perhaps most conspicuous
in the monasteries, for many monastic establishments had not been
greatly affected by the Cluniac movement of the previous century, and
in many of those which had been touched temporarily the purifying
influences had about ceased to produce results. It was as a monastic
reformer that St. Bernard rendered greatest service to the Church of
his day, though he was far more than a mere zealot. He was, says
Professor Emerton, more than any other man, representative of the
spirit of the Middle Ages. "The monastery meant to him, not a place of
easy and luxurious retirement, where a man might keep himself pure
from earthly contact, nor even a home of learning, from which a man
might influence his world. It meant rather a place of pitiless discipline,
whereby the natural man should be reduced to the lowest terms and
thus the spiritual life be given its largest liberty. The aim of Bernard
was nothing less than the regeneration of society through the presence
in it of devoted men, bound together by a compact organization, and
holding up to the world the highest types of an ideal which had already
fixed itself in the imagination of the age."<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The founding of Clairvaux by St. Bernard, in 1115, was not the beginning
of a new monastic order; the Cistercians, to whom the establishment
properly belonged, had originated at Cîteaux seventeen years
before. But in later times St. Bernard was very properly regarded as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
second founder of the Cistercians, and the story of his going forth from
the parent house to establish the new one affords an excellent illustration
of the spirit which dominated the leaders in monastic reform in
the eleventh and twelfth centuries and of the methods they employed
to keep alive the lofty ideals of the old Benedictine system; and, although
individual monasteries were founded under the most diverse
circumstances, the story is of interest as showing us the precise way in
which one monastic house took its origin. By the time of St. Bernard's
death (1153) not fewer than a hundred and fifty religious houses had
been regenerated under his inspiration.</p>

<p>We are fortunate in possessing a composite biography of the great
reformer which is practically contemporary. It is in five books, the first
of which was written by William, abbot of St. Thierry of Rheims; the
second by Arnold, abbot of Bonneval, near Chartres; and the third,
fourth, and fifth by Geoffrey, a monk of Clairvaux and a former secretary
of St. Bernard. William of St. Thierry (from whose portion of the
biography selection "a" below is taken) wrote about 1140, Arnold and
Geoffrey soon after Bernard's death in 1153.</p>

<p class="center">(a)</p>

<p>Saint Bernard was born at Fontaines in Burgundy [near
Dijon], at the castle of his father. His parents were famed
among the famous of that age, most of all because of their piety.
His father, Tescelin, was a member of an ancient and knightly
family, fearing God and scrupulously just. Even when engaged
in holy war he plundered and destroyed no one; he contented
himself with his worldly possessions, of which he had an abundance,
and used them in all manner of good works. With both
<span class="sidebar">Bernard's
parents</span>
his counsel and his arms he served temporal lords,
but so as never to neglect to render to the sovereign
Lord that which was due Him. Bernard's mother, Alith,
of the castle Montbar, mindful of holy law, was submissive to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
her husband and, with him, governed the household in the fear
of God, devoting herself to deeds of mercy and rearing her children
in strict discipline. She bore seven children, six boys and
one girl, not so much for the glory of her husband as for that
of God; for all the sons became monks and the daughter a
nun....<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>As soon as Bernard was of sufficient age his mother intrusted
his education to the teachers in the church at Châtillon<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> and
did everything in her power to enable him to make rapid progress.
The young boy, abounding in pleasing qualities and endowed
with natural genius, fulfilled his mother's every expectation;
for he advanced in his study of letters at a speed beyond
his age and that of other children of the same age. But in secular
matters he began already, and very naturally, to humble himself
<span class="sidebar">His early
characteristics</span>
in the interest of his future perfection, for
he exhibited the greatest simplicity, loved to be
in solitude, fled from people, was extraordinarily thoughtful,
submitted himself implicitly to his parents, had little desire to
converse, was devoted to God, and applied himself to his studies
as the means by which he should be able to learn of God through
the Scriptures....</p>

<p>Determined that it would be best for him to abandon the
world, he began to inquire where his soul, under the yoke of
Christ, would be able to find the most complete and sure repose.
The recent establishment of the order of Cîteaux<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> suggested
itself to his thought. The harvest was abundant, but the
<span class="sidebar">He decides to
become a monk
at Cîteaux</span>
laborers were few, for hardly any one had sought
happiness by taking up residence there, because of
the excessive austerity of life and the poverty
which there prevailed, but which had no terrors for the soul truly
seeking God. Without hesitation or misgivings, he turned his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
steps to that place, thinking that there he would be able to find
seclusion and, in the secret of the presence of God, escape the
importunities of men; wishing particularly there to gain a refuge
from the vain glory of the noble's life, and to win purity of soul,
and perhaps the name of saint.</p>

<p>When his brothers, who loved him according to the flesh,
discovered that he intended to become a monk, they employed
every means to turn him to the pursuit of letters and to attach
him to the secular life by the love of worldly knowledge. Without
doubt, as he has himself declared, he was not a little moved
by their arguments. But the memory of his devout mother
urged him importunately to take the step. It often seemed to
him that she appeared before him, reproaching him and reminding
him that she had not reared him for frivolous things of that
sort, and that she had brought him up in quite another hope.
Finally, one day when he was returning from the siege of a
château called Grancey, and was coming to his brothers, who
were with the duke of Burgundy, he began to be violently tormented
by these thoughts. Finding by the roadside a church,
he went in and there prayed, with flooded eyes, lifting his hands
toward Heaven and pouring out his heart like water before the
Lord. That day fixed his resolution irrevocably. From that
<span class="sidebar">His struggle
and his victory</span>
hour, even as the fire consumes the forests and
the flame ravages the mountains, seizing everything,
devouring first that which is nearest but advancing to
objects farther removed, so did the fire which God had kindled
in the heart of his servant, desiring that it should consume it,
lay hold first of his brothers (of whom only the youngest, incapable
yet of becoming a monk, was left to console his old
father), then his parents, his companions, and his friends, from
whom no one had ever expected such a step....</p>

<p>The number of those who decided to take upon themselves
monastic vows increased and, as one reads of the earliest sons
of the Church, "all the multitude of those who believed were of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
one mind and one heart" [Acts v. 32]. They lived together and
no one else dared mingle with them. They had at Châtillon a
house which they possessed in common and in which they held
meetings, dwelt together, and held converse with one another.
<span class="sidebar">Bernard and
his companions
at Châtillon</span>
No one was so bold as to enter it, unless he were
a member of the congregation. If any one entered
there, seeing and hearing what was done
and said (as the Apostle declared of the Christians of Corinth),
he was convinced by their prophecies and, adoring the Lord and
perceiving that God was truly among them, he either joined himself
to the brotherhood or, going away, wept at his own plight
and their happy state....</p>

<p>At that time, the young and feeble establishment at Cîteaux,
under the venerable abbot Stephen,<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> began to be seriously weakened
by its paucity of numbers and to lose all hope of having
successors to perpetuate the heritage of holy poverty, for everybody
revered the life of these monks for its sanctity but held aloof
from it because of its austerity. But the monastery was suddenly
<span class="sidebar">They enter
Cîteaux</span>
visited and made glad by the Lord in a
happy and unhoped-for manner. In 1113, fifteen
years after the foundation of the monastery, the servant of God,
Bernard, then about twenty-three years of age, entered the
establishment under the abbot Stephen, with his companions
to the number of more than thirty, and submitted himself to the
blessed yoke of Christ. From that day God prospered the house,
and that vine of the Lord bore fruit, putting forth its branches
from sea to sea.</p>

<p>Such were the holy beginnings of the monastic life of that
man of God. It is impossible to any one who has not been imbued
as he with the spirit of God to recount the illustrious deeds
of his career, and his angelic conduct, during his life on earth.
He entered the monastery poor in spirit, still obscure and of no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
fame, with the intention of there perishing in the heart and
memory of men, and hoping to be forgotten and ignored like a
lost vessel. But God ordered it otherwise, and prepared him as
a chosen vessel, not only to strengthen and extend the monastic
order, but also to bear His name before kings and peoples to the
ends of the earth....</p>

<p>At the time of harvest the brothers were occupied, with the
fervor and joy of the Holy Spirit, in reaping the grain. Since
he [Bernard] was not able to have part in the labor, they bade
him sit by them and take his ease. Greatly troubled, he had
<span class="sidebar">Bernard prays
for and obtains
the ability to
reap</span>
recourse to prayer and, with much weeping, implored
the Lord to grant him the strength to become
a reaper. The simplicity of his faith did not
deceive him, for that which he asked he obtained. Indeed from
that day he prided himself in being more skilful than the others at
that task; and he was the more given over to devotion during
that labor because he realized that the ability to perform it
was a direct gift from God. Refreshed by his employments of
this kind, he prayed, read, or meditated continuously. If an
opportunity for prayer in solitude offered itself, he seized it; but
in any case, whether by himself or with companions, he preserved
a solitude in his heart, and thus was everywhere alone. He read
gladly, and always with faith and thoughtfulness, the Holy
Scriptures, saying that they never seemed to him so clear as
when read in the text alone, and he declared his ability to discern
their truth and divine virtue much more readily in the
<span class="sidebar">His devotion
and knowledge
of the Scriptures</span>
source itself than in the commentaries which
were derived from it. Nevertheless, he read
humbly the saints and orthodox commentators
and made no pretense of rivaling their knowledge; but, submitting
his to theirs, and tracing it faithfully to its sources, he
drank often at the fountain whence they had drawn. It is thus
that, full of the spirit which has divinely inspired all Holy Scripture,
he has served God to this day, as the Apostle says, with so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
great confidence, and such ability to instruct, convert, and sway.
And when he preaches the word of God, he renders so clear and
agreeable that which he takes from Scripture to insert in his
discourse, and he has such power to move men, that everybody,
both those clever in worldly matters and those who possess
spiritual knowledge, marvel at the eloquent words which fall
from his lips.</p>

<p class="center">(b)</p>

<p>Twelve monks and their abbot, representing our Lord and His
apostles, were assembled in the church. Stephen placed a cross
in Bernard's hands, who solemnly, at the head of his small band,
walked forth from Cîteaux.... Bernard struck away to
the northward. For a distance of nearly ninety miles he kept
this course, passing up by the source of the Seine, by Châtillon,
of school-day memories, until he arrived at La Ferté, about
<span class="sidebar">Site selected
for the new
monastery</span>
equally distant between Troyes and Chaumont,
in the diocese of Langres, and situated on the
river Aube.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> About four miles beyond La Ferté
was a deep valley opening to the east. Thick umbrageous forests
gave it a character of gloom and wildness; but a gushing stream
of limpid water which ran through it was sufficient to redeem
every disadvantage.</p>

<p>In June, 1115, Bernard took up his abode in the "Valley of
Wormwood," as it was called, and began to look for means of
shelter and sustenance against the approaching winter. The
<span class="sidebar">The first building
constructed</span>
rude fabric which he and his monks raised with
their own hands was long preserved by the pious
veneration of the Cistercians. It consisted of
a building covered by a single roof, under which chapel, dormitory,
and refectory were all included. Neither stone nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
wood hid the bare earth, which served for a floor. Windows
scarcely wider than a man's head admitted a feeble light. In
this room the monks took their frugal meals of herbs and water.
Immediately above the refectory was the sleeping apartment.
It was reached by a ladder, and was, in truth, a sort of loft.
Here were the monks' beds, which were peculiar. They were
made in the form of boxes, or bins, of wooden planks, long and
wide enough for a man to lie down in. A small space, hewn out
with an axe, allowed room for the sleeper to get in or out. The
inside was strewn with chaff, or dried leaves, which, with the
woodwork, seem to have been the only covering permitted....</p>

<p>The monks had thus got a house over their heads; but they
had very little else. They had left Cîteaux in June. Their
journey had probably occupied them a fortnight; their clearing,
preparations, and building, perhaps two months; and thus they
were near September when this portion of their labor was accomplished.
Autumn and winter were approaching, and they
had no store laid by. Their food during the summer had been
a compound of leaves intermixed with coarse grain. Beech-nuts
and roots were to be their main support during the winter.
<span class="sidebar">Hardships
encountered</span>
And now to the privations of insufficient food
was added the wearing out of their shoes and
clothes. Their necessities grew with the severity of the season,
until at last even salt failed them; and presently Bernard heard
murmurs. He argued and exhorted; he spoke to them of the
fear and love of God, and strove to rouse their drooping spirits
by dwelling on the hopes of eternal life and Divine recompense.
Their sufferings made them deaf and indifferent to their abbot's
words. They would not remain in this valley of bitterness; they
would return to Cîteaux. Bernard, seeing they had lost their
trust in God, reproved them no more; but himself sought in
earnest prayer for release from their difficulties. Presently a
voice from heaven said, "Arise, Bernard, thy prayer is granted
thee." Upon which the monks said, "What didst thou ask of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
the Lord?" "Wait, and ye shall see, ye of little faith," was the
reply; and presently came a stranger who gave the abbot ten
livres.</p>

<h4>44. A Description of Clairvaux</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The following is an interesting description of the abbey of Clairvaux,
written by William of St. Thierry, the friend and biographer of Bernard.
After giving an account of the external appearance and surroundings
of the monastery, the writer goes on to portray the daily life and devotion
of the monks who resided in it. In reading the description it
should be borne in mind that Clairvaux was a new establishment,
founded expressly to further the work of monastic reform, and that
therefore at the time when William of St. Thierry knew it, it exhibited
a state of piety and industry considerably above that to be found in
the average abbey of the day.</p>
</div>

of Saint Thierry, "Life of St. Bernard"], Bk. I., Chap. 7. Translated
in Edward L. Cutts, <i>Scenes and Characters of the Middle
Ages</i> (London, 1872), pp. 12-14.</p>

<p>At the first glance as you entered Clairvaux by descending the
hill you could see that it was a temple of God; and the still,
silent valley bespoke, in the modest simplicity of its buildings,
the unfeigned humility of Christ's poor. Moreover, in this valley
full of men, where no one was permitted to be idle, where one
and all were occupied with their allotted tasks, a silence deep
<span class="sidebar">The solitude
of Clairvaux</span>
as that of night prevailed. The sounds of labor, or
the chants of the brethren in the choral service,
were the only exceptions. The orderliness of this silence, and
the report that went forth concerning it, struck such a reverence
even into secular persons that they dreaded breaking it,&mdash;I will
not say by idle or wicked conversation, but even by proper
remarks. The solitude, also, of the place&mdash;between dense forests
in a narrow gorge of neighboring hills&mdash;in a certain sense recalled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
the cave of our father St. Benedict,<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> so that while they strove
to imitate his life, they also had some similarity to him in their
habitation and loneliness....</p>

<p>Although the monastery is situated in a valley, it has its
foundations on the holy hills, whose gates the Lord loveth more
than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken of
it, because the glorious and wonderful God therein worketh great
marvels. There the insane recover their reason, and although
their outward man is worn away, inwardly they are born again.
<span class="sidebar">Marvelous
works accomplished
there</span>

There the proud are humbled, the rich are made
poor, and the poor have the Gospel preached to
them, and the darkness of sinners is changed
into light. A large multitude of blessed poor from the ends of
the earth have there assembled, yet have they one heart and
one mind; justly, therefore, do all who dwell there rejoice with
no empty joy. They have the certain hope of perennial joy, of
their ascension heavenward already commenced. In Clairvaux,
they have found Jacob's ladder, with angels upon it; some
descending, who so provide for their bodies that they faint not
on the way; others ascending, who so rule their souls that their
bodies hereafter may be glorified with them.</p>

<p>For my part, the more attentively I watch them day by day,
the more do I believe that they are perfect followers of Christ
in all things. When they pray and speak to God in spirit and
in truth, by their friendly and quiet speech to Him, as well
<span class="sidebar">The piety of
the monks</span>
as by their humbleness of demeanor, they are
plainly seen to be God's companions and friends.
When, on the other hand, they openly praise God with psalms,
how pure and fervent are their minds, is shown by their posture
of body in holy fear and reverence, while by their careful pronunciation
and modulation of the psalms, is shown how sweet to
their lips are the words of God&mdash;sweeter than honey to their
mouths. As I watch them, therefore, singing without fatigue
from before midnight to the dawn of day, with only a brief interval,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
they appear a little less than the angels, but much more
than men....</p>

<p>As regards their manual labor, so patiently and placidly, with
such quiet countenances, in such sweet and holy order, do they
perform all things, that although they exercise themselves at
many works, they never seem moved or burdened in anything,
whatever the labor may be. Whence it is manifest that that
Holy Spirit worketh in them who disposeth of all things with
sweetness, in whom they are refreshed, so that they rest even
<span class="sidebar">Their manual
labor</span>
in their toil. Many of them, I hear, are bishops
and earls, and many illustrious through their
birth or knowledge; but now, by God's grace, all distinction of
persons being dead among them, the greater any one thought
himself in the world, the more in this flock does he regard himself
as less than the least. I see them in the garden with hoes, in the
meadows with forks or rakes, in the fields with scythes, in the
forest with axes. To judge from their outward appearance,
their tools, their bad and disordered clothes, they appear a race
of fools, without speech or sense. But a true thought in my mind
tells me that their life in Christ is hidden in the heavens. Among
them I see Godfrey of Peronne, Raynald of Picardy, William of
St. Omer, Walter of Lisle, all of whom I knew formerly in the
old man, whereof I now see no trace, by God's favor. I knew
them proud and puffed up; I see them walking humbly under
the merciful hand of God.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
THE CONFLICT OVER INVESTITURE</h3>

<h4>45. Gregory VII.'s Conception of the Papal Authority</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Hildebrand, who as pope was known as Gregory VII., was born
about the year 1025 in the vicinity of the little Tuscan town of Soana.
His education was received in the rich monastery of Saint Mary on the
Aventine, of which one of his uncles was abbot. At the age of twenty-five
he became chaplain to Pope Gregory VI., after whose fall from
power he sought seclusion in the monastery at Cluny. In 1049, however,
he again appeared in Italy, this time in the rôle of companion to
the new pontiff, Leo IX. In a few years he became sub-deacon and
cardinal and was intrusted with the municipal affairs and financial interests
of the Holy See. He served as papal legate in France and in
1057 was sent to Germany to obtain the consent of Empress Agnes to
the hurried election of Stephen IX. While in these countries he became
convinced that the evil conditions&mdash;simony, lay investiture, and
non-celibacy of the clergy&mdash;which the Cluniacs were seeking to reform
would never be materially improved by the temporal powers, and consequently
that the only hope of betterment lay in the establishing of
an absolute papal supremacy before which kings, and even emperors,
should be compelled to bow in submission. In April, 1073, Hildebrand
himself was made pope, nominally by the vote of the College of Cardinals,
but really by the enthusiastic choice of the Roman populace. His
whole training and experience had fitted him admirably for the place
and had equipped him with the capacity to make of his office something
more than had any of his predecessors. When he became pope
it was with a very lofty ideal of what the papacy should be, and the
surprising measure in which he was able to realize this ideal entitles
him without question to be regarded as the greatest of all mediæval
popes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>In the document given below, the so-called <i>Dictatus Papæ</i>, Pope Gregory's
conception of the nature of the papal power and its proper place
in the world is stated in the form of a clear and forcible summary.
Until recently the <i>Dictatus</i> was supposed to have been written by Gregory
himself, but it has been fairly well demonstrated that it was composed
not earlier than 1087 and was therefore the work of some one else
(Gregory died in 1085). It conforms very closely to a collection of the
laws of the Church published in 1087 by a certain cardinal by the name
of Deusdedit. The document loses little or none of its value by reason
of this uncertainty as to its authorship, for it represents Pope Gregory's
views as accurately as if he were known to have written it. In judging
Gregory's theories it should be borne in mind (1) that it was not personal
ambition, but sincere conviction, that lay beneath them; (2) that the
temporal states which existed in western Europe in Gregory's day were
rife with feudal anarchy and oppression and often too weak to be capable
of rendering justice; and (3) that Gregory claimed, not that the Church
should actually assume the management of the civil government
throughout Europe, but only that in cases of notorious failure of temporal
sovereigns to live right and govern well, the supreme authority
of the papacy should be brought to bear upon them, either to depose
them or to compel them to mend their ways. It is worthy of note,
however, that Gregory was careful to lay the foundations of a formidable
political power in Italy, chiefly by availing himself of the practices of
feudalism, as seen, for example, in the grant of southern Italy to the
Norman Robert Guiscard to be held as a fief of the Roman see.</p>

<h4>46. Letter of Gregory VII. to Henry IV. (December, 1075)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The high ideal of papal supremacy over temporal sovereigns which
Gregory cherished when he became pope in 1073, and which is set
forth so forcibly in the <i>Dictatus</i>, was one whose validity no king or
emperor could be brought to recognize. It involved an attitude of
inferiority and submissiveness which monarchs felt to be quite inconsistent
with the complete independence which they claimed in the
management of the affairs of their respective states. Perhaps one may
say that the theory in itself, as a mere expression of religious sentiment,
was not especially obnoxious; many an earlier pope had proclaimed it
in substance without doing the kings and emperors of Europe material
injury. It was the firm determination and the aggressive effort of
Gregory to reduce the theory to an actual working system that precipitated
a conflict.</p>

<p>The supreme test of Gregory's ability to make the papal power felt in
the measure that he thought it should be came early in the pontificate in
the famous breach with Henry IV. of Germany. Henry at the time was
not emperor in name, but only "king of the Romans," the imperial
coronation not yet having taken place.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> For all practical purposes,
however, he may be regarded as occupying the emperor's position, since
all that was lacking was the performance of a more or less perfunctory
ceremony. Henry's specific grievances against the Pope were that the
latter had declared it a sin for an ecclesiastic to be invested with his
office by a layman, though this was almost the universal practice in
Germany, and that he had condemned five of the king's councilors for
simony,<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> suspended the archbishop of Bremen, the bishops of Speyer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
and Strassburg, and two Lombard bishops, and deposed the bishop of
Florence. Half of the land and wealth of Germany was in the hands
of bishops and abbots who, if the Pope were to have his way, would be
released from all practical dependence upon the king and so would be
free to encourage and take part in the feudal revolts which Henry was
exerting himself so vigorously to crush. June 8, 1075, on the banks of
the Unstrutt, the king won a signal victory over the rebellious feudal
lords, after which he felt strong enough to defy the authority of
Gregory with impunity. He therefore continued to associate with the
five condemned councilors and, in contempt of recent papal declarations
against lay investiture, took it upon himself to appoint and invest
a number of bishops and abbots, though always with extreme care that
the right kind of men be selected. Pope Gregory was, of course, not
the man to overlook such conduct and at once made vigorous protest.
The letter given below was written in December, 1075, and is one of a
considerable series which passed back and forth across the Alps prior
to the breaking of the storm in 1076-1077. At this stage matters had
not yet got beyond the possibility of compromise and reconciliation;
in fact Gregory writes as much as anything else to get the king's own
statement regarding the reports of his conduct which had come to
Rome. The tone of the letter is firm, it is true, but conciliatory. The
thunder of subsequent epistles to the recreant Henry had not yet been
brought into play.</p>

<p>Gregory, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to Henry, the
king, greeting and apostolic benediction,&mdash;that is, if he be obedient
to the apostolic see as is becoming in a Christian king:</p>

<p>It is with some hesitation that we have sent you our apostolic
benediction, knowing that for all our acts as pope we must
render an account to God, the severe judge. It is reported that
you have willingly associated with men who have been excommunicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
by decree of the Pope and sentence of a synod.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> If
this be true, you are very well aware that you can receive the
blessing neither of God nor of the Pope until you have driven
<span class="sidebar">Henry exhorted
to confess
his sins</span>
them from you and have compelled them to do
penance, and have also yourself sought absolution
and forgiveness for your transgressions with due
repentance and good works. Therefore we advise you that, if
you realize your guilt in this matter, you immediately confess
to some pious bishop, who shall absolve you with our permission,
prescribing for you penance in proportion to the fault, and who
shall faithfully report to us by letter, with your permission, the
nature of the penance required.</p>

<p>We wonder, moreover, that you should continue to assure us
by letter and messengers of your devotion and humility; that
you should call yourself our son and the son of the holy mother
Church, obedient in the faith, sincere in love, diligent in devotion;
and that you should commend yourself to us with all zeal
of love and reverence&mdash;whereas in fact you are constantly
disobeying the canonical and apostolic decrees in important
matters of the faith.... Since you confess yourself a son
of the Church, you should treat with more honor the head of
the Church, that is, St. Peter, the prince of the apostles. If you
are one of the sheep of the Lord, you have been entrusted to
<span class="sidebar">The Pope's
claim to authority
over
temporal
princes</span>
him by divine authority, for Christ said to him:
"Peter, feed my sheep" [John, xxi. 16]; and again:
"And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
of Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt
loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" [Matt., xvi. 19]. And
since we, although an unworthy sinner, exercise his authority by
divine will, the words which you address to us are in reality addressed
directly to him. And although we read or hear only the
words, he sees the heart from which the words proceed. Therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
your highness should be very careful that no insincerity be
found in your words and messages to us; and that you show due
reverence, not to us, indeed, but to omnipotent God, in those
things which especially make for the advance of the Christian
faith and the well-being of the Church. For our Lord said to the
apostles and to their successors: "He that heareth you heareth
me, and he that despiseth you despiseth me" [Luke, x. 16].
For no one will disregard our admonitions if he believes that the
decrees of the Pope have the same authority as the words of the
apostle himself....<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Now in the synod held at the apostolic seat to which the divine
will has called us (at which some of your subjects also were
present) we, seeing that the Christian religion had been weakened
by many attacks and that the chief and proper motive,
that of saving souls, had for a long time been neglected and
slighted, were alarmed at the evident danger of the destruction
of the flock of the Lord, and had recourse to the decrees and the
<span class="sidebar">Abuses in the
Church to be
corrected</span>
doctrine of the holy fathers. We decreed nothing
new, nothing of our invention; but we decided
that the error should be abandoned and the single
primitive rule of ecclesiastical discipline and the familiar way
of the saints should be again sought out and followed.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> For we
know that no other door to salvation and eternal life lies open
to the sheep of Christ than that which was pointed out by Him
who said: "I am the door: by me if any man enter in he shall be
saved, and find pasture" [John, x. 9]; and this, we learn from
the gospels and from the sacred writings, was preached by the
apostles and observed by the holy fathers. And we have decided
that this decree&mdash;which some, placing human above divine
honor, have called an unendurable weight and an immense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
burden, but which we call by its proper name, that is, the truth
and light necessary to salvation&mdash;is to be received and observed
not only by you and your subjects, but also by all princes and
peoples of the earth who confess and worship Christ; for it is
greatly desired by us, and would be most fitting to you, that
as you are greater than others in glory, in honor, and in virtue,
so you should be more distinguished in devotion to Christ.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, that this decree may not seem to you beyond
measure grievous and unjust, we have commanded you by your
faithful ambassadors to send to us the wisest and most pious men
whom you can find in your kingdom, so that if they can show
or instruct us in any way how we can temper the sentence
<span class="sidebar">Gregory disposed
to treat
Henry fairly</span>
promulgated by the holy fathers without offense
to the eternal King or danger to our souls, we
may consider their advice. But, even if we had
not warned you in so friendly a manner, it would have been only
right on your part, before you violated the apostolic decrees, to
ask justice of us in a reasonable manner in any matter in which
we had injured or affected your honor. But from what you
have since done and decreed it is evident how little you care
for our warnings, or for the observance of justice.</p>

<p>But since we hope that, while the long-suffering patience of
God still invites you to repent, you may become wiser and your
heart may be turned to obey the commands of God, we warn
you with fatherly love that, knowing the rule of Christ to be
over you, you should consider how dangerous it is to place your
honor above His, and that you should not interfere with the
liberty of the Church which He has deigned to join to Himself
by heavenly union, but rather with faithful devotion you should
offer your assistance to the increasing of this liberty to omnipotent
God and St. Peter, through whom also your glory may be
enhanced. You ought to recognize what you undoubtedly owe
to them for giving you victory over your enemies,<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> that as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
have gladdened you with great prosperity, so they should see
that you are thereby rendered more devout. And in order that
<span class="sidebar">Henry's obligation
to serve
and obey the
papacy</span>
the fear of God, in whose hands is all power and
all rule, may affect your heart more than these
our warnings, you should recall what happened
to Saul, when, after winning the victory which he gained by
the will of the prophet, he glorified himself in his triumph and
did not obey the warnings of the prophet, and how God reproved
him; and, on the other hand, what grace King David acquired
by reason of his humility, as well as his other virtues.</p>

<h4>47. Henry IV.'s Reply to Gregory's Letter (January, 1076)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In 1059, when Nicholas II. was pope and Hildebrand was yet only a
cardinal, a council assembled at the Lateran decreed that henceforth
the right of electing the sovereign pontiff should be vested exclusively
in the college of cardinals, or in other words, in seven cardinal bishops
in the vicinity of Rome and a certain number of cardinal priests and
deacons attached to the parishes of the city. The people and clergy
generally were deprived of participation in the election, except so far
as merely to give their consent. Hildebrand seems to have been the
real author of the decree. Nevertheless, in 1073, when he was elevated
to the papal chair, the decree of 1059 was in a measure ignored, for he
was elected by popular vote and his choice was only passively sanctioned
by the cardinals. When, therefore, the quarrel between him and
Henry IV. came on, the latter was not slow to make use of the weapon
which Hildebrand's (or Gregory's) uncanonical election placed in his
hands. In replying, January 24, 1076, to the papal letter of December,
1075, he bluntly addresses himself to "Hildebrand, not pope, but
false monk," and writes a stinging epistle in the tone thus assumed
in his salutation. In his arraignment of Gregory the king doubtless
went far beyond the truth; but the fact remains that Gregory's dominating
purposes in the interest of the papal authority threatened to cut
deeply into the independence of all temporal sovereigns, and therefore
rendered such resistance as Henry offered quite inevitable. In the interim
between receiving the Pope's letter and dispatching his reply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Henry had convened at Worms a council of the German clergy, and
this body had decreed that Gregory, having wrongfully ascended the
papal throne, should be compelled forthwith to abdicate it.</p>

<p>Henry, king not by usurpation, but by the holy ordination
of God, to Hildebrand, not pope, but false monk.</p>

<p>This is the salutation which you deserve, for you have never
held any office in the Church without making it a source of confusion
and a curse to Christian men, instead of an honor and a
blessing. To mention only the most obvious cases out of many,
you have not only dared to lay hands on the Lord's anointed,
the archbishops, bishops, and priests, but you have scorned
<span class="sidebar">Gregory declared
to be
only a demagogue</span>
them and abused them, as if they were ignorant
servants not fit to know what their master was
doing. This you have done to gain favor with
the vulgar crowd. You have declared that the bishops know
nothing and that you know everything; but if you have such
great wisdom you have used it not to build but to destroy.
Therefore we believe that St. Gregory, whose name you have
presumed to take, had you in mind when he said: "The heart of
the prelate is puffed up by the abundance of subjects, and he
thinks himself more powerful than all others." All this we have
endured because of our respect for the papal office, but you have
mistaken our humility for fear, and have dared to make an
attack upon the royal and imperial authority which we received
<span class="sidebar">The papal
claim to temporal
supremacy
rejected</span>
from God. You have even threatened to take it
away, as if we had received it from you, and as if
the Empire and kingdom were in your disposal
and not in the disposal of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ has
called us to the government of the Empire, but He never
called you to the rule of the Church. This is the way you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
have gained advancement in the Church: through craft you have
obtained wealth; through wealth you have obtained favor;
through favor, the power of the sword; and through the power
of the sword, the papal seat, which is the seat of peace; and then
from the seat of peace you have expelled peace. For you have
incited subjects to rebel against their prelates by teaching them
to despise the bishops, their rightful rulers. You have given to
laymen the authority over priests, whereby they condemn and
depose those whom the bishops have put over them to teach
them. You have attacked me, who, unworthy as I am, have
yet been anointed to rule among the anointed of God, and who,
according to the teaching of the fathers, can be judged by no
one save God alone, and can be deposed for no crime except
infidelity. For the holy fathers in the time of the apostate
Julian<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> did not presume to pronounce sentence of deposition
against him, but left him to be judged and condemned by God.
<span class="sidebar">Henry
also cites
Scripture</span>
St. Peter himself said, "Fear God, honor the
king" [1 Pet., ii. 17]. But you, who fear not God,
have dishonored me, whom He hath established.
St. Paul, who said that even an angel from heaven should be
accursed who taught any other than the true doctrine, did not
make an exception in your favor, to permit you to teach false
doctrines. For he says, "But though we, or an angel from
heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we
have preached unto you, let him be accursed" [Gal., i. 8]. Come
down, then, from that apostolic seat which you have obtained
by violence; for you have been declared accursed by St. Paul
for your false doctrines, and have been condemned by us and
our bishops for your evil rule. Let another ascend the throne
of St. Peter, one who will not use religion as a cloak of violence,
but will teach the life-giving doctrine of that prince of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
apostles. I, Henry, king by the grace of God, with all my
bishops, say unto you: "Come down, come down, and be accursed
through all the ages."</p>

<h4>48. Henry IV. Deposed by Pope Gregory (1076)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The foregoing letter of Henry IV. was received at Rome with a storm
of disapproval and the envoys who bore it barely escaped with their
lives. A council of French and Italian bishops was convened in the Lateran
(Feb. 24, 1076), and the king's haughty epistle, together with the
decree of the council at Worms deposing Gregory, were read and allowed
to have their effect. With the assent of the bishops, the Pope pronounced
the sentence of excommunication against Henry and formally
released all the latter's Christian subjects from their oath of allegiance.
Naturally the action of Gregory aroused intense interest throughout
Europe. In Germany it had the intended effect of detaching many
influential bishops and abbots from the imperial cause and stirring
the political enemies of the king to renewed activity. The papal
ban became a pretext for the renewal of the hostility on part of
his dissatisfied subjects which Henry had but just succeeded in
suppressing.</p>

<p>In the first part of the papal decree Gregory seeks to defend himself
against the charges brought by Henry and the German clergy to the
effect that he had mounted the papal throne through personal ambition
and the employment of unbecoming means. It was indisputable
that his election had not been strictly in accord with the decree
of 1059, but it seems equally true that, as Gregory declares, he was
placed at the helm of the Church contrary to his personal desires.</p>

<p>St. Peter, prince of the apostles, incline thine ear unto me,
I beseech thee, and hear me, thy servant, whom thou hast
nourished from mine infancy and hast delivered from mine
enemies that hate me for my fidelity to thee. Thou art my witness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
as are also my mistress, the mother of God, and St. Paul
thy brother, and all the other saints, that the Holy Roman Church
<span class="sidebar">Gregory denies
that he ever
sought the
papal office</span>
called me to its government against my own will,
and that I did not gain thy throne by violence;
that I would rather have ended my days in exile
than have obtained thy place by fraud or for worldly ambition.
It is not by my efforts, but by thy grace, that I am set to rule
over the Christian world which was especially intrusted to thee
by Christ. It is by thy grace, and as thy representative that
God has given to me the power to bind and to loose in heaven
and in earth. Confident of my integrity and authority, I now
declare in the name of the omnipotent God, the Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit, that Henry, son of the Emperor Henry,<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> is
<span class="sidebar">Henry
deposed by
papal decree</span>
deprived of his kingdom of Germany and Italy.
I do this by thy authority and in defense of the
honor of thy Church, because he has rebelled
against it. He who attempts to destroy the honor of the Church
should be deprived of such honor as he may have held. He has
refused to obey as a Christian should; he has not returned to
God from whom he had wandered; he has had dealings with
excommunicated persons; he has done many iniquities; he has
despised the warnings which, as thou art witness, I sent to him
for his salvation; he has cut himself off from thy Church, and
has attempted to rend it asunder; therefore, by thy authority,
I place him under the curse. It is in thy name that I curse him,
that all people may know that thou art Peter, and upon thy
rock the Son of the living God has built his Church, and the
gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</p>

<h4>49. The Penance of Henry IV. at Canossa (1077)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In his contest with the Pope, Henry's chances of winning were from
the outset diminished by the readiness of his subjects to take advantage
of his misfortunes to recover political privileges they had lost under his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
vigorous rule. In October, 1076, the leading German nobles, lay and
clerical, encouraged by the papal decree of the preceding February,
assembled at Tribur, near Mainz, and proceeded to formulate a plan
of action. Henry, with the few followers who remained faithful, awaited
the result at Oppenheim, just across the Rhine. The magnates at last
agreed that unless Henry could secure the removal of the papal ban
within a year he should be deposed from the throne. By the Oppenheim
Convention he was forced to promise to revoke his sentence of
deposition against Gregory and to offer him his allegiance. The promise
was executed in a royal edict of the same month. Seeing that there
remained no hope in further resistance, and hearing that Gregory was
about to present himself in Germany to compel a final adjustment of
the affair, Henry fled from Speyer, where he had been instructed by
the nobles to remain, and by a most arduous winter journey over the
Alps arrived at last at the castle of Canossa, in Tuscany,<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> where the
Pope, on his way to Germany, was being entertained by one of his
allies, the Countess Matilda. Gregory might indeed already have been
on the Rhine but that he had heard of the move Henry was making and
feared that he was proposing to stir up revolt in the papal dominions.
The king was submissive, apparently conquered; yet Gregory was loath
to end the conflict at this point. He had hoped to establish a precedent
by entering German territory and there disposing of the crown according
to his own will. But it was a cardinal rule of the Church that a
penitent sincerely seeking absolution could not be denied, and in his
request Henry was certainly importunate enough to give every appearance
of sincerity. Accordingly, the result of the meeting of king [Emperor]
and Pope at Canossa was that the ban of excommunication was
revoked by the latter, while the former took an oath fully acknowledging
the papal claims.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as he had saved his crown and frustrated the design of
Gregory to cross the mountains into Germany, Henry may be said
to have won a temporary advantage; and this was followed within a
few years, when the struggle broke out again, by the practical expulsion
of Gregory from Rome and his death in broken-hearted exile (1085).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Nevertheless the moral effect of the Canossa episode, and of the events
which followed, in the long run operated decidedly against the king's
position and the whole imperial theory. The document below is a
letter of Gregory to the German magnates giving an account of the
submission of the king at Canossa, and including the text of the oath
which he there took.</p>

<p>Gregory, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all the
archbishops, bishops, dukes, counts, and other princes of the
realm of the Germans who defend the Christian faith, greeting
and apostolic benediction.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as for love of justice you assumed common cause
and danger with us in the struggle of Christian warfare, we have
taken care to inform you, beloved, with sincere affection, how
the king, humbled to penance, obtained the pardon of absolution
and how the whole affair has progressed from his entrance into
Italy to the present time.</p>

<p>As had been agreed with the legates who had been sent to us
on your part,<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> we came into Lombardy about twenty days before
the date on which one of the commanders was to come over the
<span class="sidebar">Gregory's
advance into
Tuscany</span>
pass to meet us, awaiting his advent that we
might cross over to the other side. But when the
period fixed upon had already passed, and we
were told that at this time on account of many difficulties&mdash;as
we can readily believe&mdash;an escort could not be sent to meet
us, we were involved in no little perplexity as to what would
be best for us to do, having no other means of coming to you.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, we learned that the king was approaching.
He also, before entering Italy, sent to us suppliant legates,
offering in all things to render satisfaction to God, to St. Peter,
and to us. And he renewed his promise that, besides amending
his way of living, he would observe all obedience if only he might
deserve to obtain from us the favor of absolution and the apostolic
benediction. When, after long postponing a decision and
holding frequent consultations, we, through all the envoys who
<span class="sidebar">Henry at
Canossa</span>
passed, had severely taken him to task for his
excesses, he came at length of his own accord,
with a few followers, showing nothing of hostility or boldness,
to the town of Canossa where we were tarrying. And there,
having laid aside all the belongings of royalty, wretchedly, with
bare feet and clad in wool, he continued for three days to stand
before the gate of the castle. Nor did he desist from imploring
with many tears, the aid and consolation of the apostolic mercy
until he had moved all of those who were present there, and
whom the report of it reached, to such pity and depth of compassion
that, interceding for him with many prayers and tears,
all wondered indeed at the unaccustomed hardness of our heart,
while some actually cried out that we were exercising, not the
dignity of apostolic severity, but the cruelty, as it were, of a
tyrannical madness.</p>

<p>Finally, won by the persistency of his suit and by the constant
supplications of all who were present, we loosed the chain
of the anathema<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> and at length received him into the favor of
communion and into the lap of the holy mother Church, those
being accepted as sponsors for him whose names are written
below.</p>

<p>Having thus accomplished these matters, we desire at the first
opportunity to cross over to your country in order that, by
God's aid, we may more fully arrange all things for the peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
of the Church and the concord of the kingdom, as has long
been our wish. For we desire, beloved, that you should know
<span class="sidebar">Gregory's purpose
to visit
Germany</span>
beyond a doubt that the whole question at issue
is as yet so little cleared up&mdash;as you can learn
from the sponsors mentioned&mdash;that both our
coming and the concurrence of your counsels are extremely
necessary. Wherefore strive ye all to continue in the faith in
which you have begun and in the love of justice; and know that
we are not otherwise committed to the king save that, by word
alone, as is our custom, we have said that he might have hopes
from us in those matters in which, without danger to his soul
or to our own, we might be able to help him to his salvation and
honor, either through justice or through mercy.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Oath of King Henry</span></p>

<p>I, King Henry, on account of the murmuring and enmity
which the archbishops and bishops, dukes, counts and other
princes of the realm of the Germans, and others who follow them
in the same matter of dissension, bring to bear against me, will,
within the term which our master Pope Gregory has constituted,
either do justice according to his judgment or conclude peace
according to his counsels&mdash;unless an absolute impediment should
stand in his way or in mine. And on the removal of this impediment
I shall be ready to continue in the same course. Likewise,
if that same lord Pope Gregory shall wish to go beyond the
mountains [i.e., into Germany], or to any other part of the
world, he himself, as well as those who shall be in his escort or
following, or who are sent by him, or come to him from any parts
of the world whatever, shall be secure while going, remaining,
or returning, on my part, and on the part of those whom I can
constrain, from every injury to life or limb, or from capture.
Nor shall he, by my consent, meet any other hindrance that is
contrary to his dignity; and if any such be placed in his way I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
will aid him according to my ability. So help me God and this
holy gospel.</p>

<h4>50. The Concordat of Worms (1122)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The veteran Emperor Henry IV. died at Liège in 1106 and was succeeded
by his son, Henry V. The younger Henry had some months before
been prompted by Pope Paschal II. to rebel against his father and,
succeeding in this, had practically established himself on the throne
before his legitimate time. Pope Paschal expected the son to be more
submissive than the father had been and in 1106 issued a decree renewing
the prohibition of lay investiture. Outside of Germany this
evil had been brought almost to an end and, now that the vigorous
Henry IV. was out of the way, the Pope felt that the time had come to
make the reform complete throughout Christendom. But in this he
was mistaken, for Henry V. proved almost as able and fully as determined
a power to contend with as had been his father. In fact, the new
monarch could command a much stronger army, and he was in no wise
loath to use it. In 1110 he led a host of thirty thousand men across
the Alps, compelled the submission of the north Italian towns, and
marched on Rome. The outcome was a secret compact (February 4,
1111) by which the king, on the one hand, was to abandon all claim to the
right of investiture and the Pope, on the other, was to see that the ecclesiastical
princes of the Empire (bishops and abbots holding large tracts
of land) should give up all the lands which they had received by royal
grant since the days of Charlemagne. The abandonment of investiture
looked like a surrender on the part of Henry, but in reality all that he
wanted was direct control over all the lands of the Empire, and if the
ecclesiastical princes were to be dispossessed of these he cared little or
nothing about having a part in the mere religious ceremony. This
settlement was rendered impossible, however, by the attitude of the
princes themselves, who naturally refused to be thus deprived of their
landed property and chief source of income. The Pope was then forced
to make a second compact surrendering the full right of investiture to
the imperial authority, and Henry also got the coveted imperial coronation.
But his triumph was short-lived. Rebellions among the German
nobles robbed him of his strength and after years of wearisome bickerings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
and petty conflicts he again came to the point where he was willing
to compromise. Calixtus II., who became pope in 1119, was similarly
inclined.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in a diet at Worms, in 1122, the whole problem
was taken up for settlement, and happily this time with success. The
documents translated below contain the concessions made mutually by
the two parties. Calixtus, in brief, grants that the elections of bishops
and abbots may take place in the presence of the Emperor, or of his
agents, and that the Emperor should have the right to invest them with
the scepter, i.e., with their dignity as princes of the Empire. Henry,
on his side, agrees to give up investiture with the ring and staff, i.e.,
with spiritual functions, to allow free elections, and to aid in the
restoration of church property which had been confiscated during the
long struggle now drawing to a close. The settlement was in the nature
of a compromise; but on the whole the papacy came off the better.
In its largest aspects the great fifty-year struggle over the question
of investiture was ended, though minor features of it remained to trouble
all parties concerned for a long time to come.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
THE CRUSADES</h3>

<h4>51. Speech of Pope Urban II. at the Council of Clermont (1095)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Within a short time after the death of Mohammed (632) the whole
country of Syria, including Palestine, was overrun by the Arabs, and the
Holy City of Jerusalem passed out of Christian hands into the control of
the infidels. The Arabs, however, shared the veneration of the Christians
for the places associated with the life of Christ and did not greatly
interfere with the pilgrims who flocked thither from all parts of the Christian
world. In the tenth century the strong emperors of the Macedonian
dynasty at Constantinople succeeded in winning back all of
Syria except the extreme south, and the prospect seemed fair for the
permanent possession by a Christian power of all those portions of the
Holy Land which were regarded as having associations peculiarly sacred.
This prospect might have been realized but for the invasions and conquests
of the Seljuk Turks in the latter part of the eleventh century.
These Turks came from central Asia and are to be carefully distinguished
from the Ottoman Turks of more modern times. They had recently
been converted to Mohammedanism and were now the fiercest and most
formidable champions of that faith in its conflict with the Christian
East. In 1071 Emperor Romanus Diogenes was defeated at Manzikert,
in Armenia, and taken prisoner by the sultan Alp Arslan, and as a result
not only Asia Minor, but also Syria, was forever lost to the Empire.
The Holy City of Jerusalem was definitely occupied in 1076. The invaders
established a stronghold at Nicæa, less than a hundred miles
across the Sea of Marmora from Constantinople, and even threatened
the capital itself, although they did not finally succeed in taking it until
1453.</p>

<p>No sooner were the Turks in possession of Jerusalem and the approaches
thither, than pilgrims returning to western Europe began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
tell tales, not infrequently as true as they were terrifying, regarding insults
and tortures suffered at the hand of the pitiless conquerors. The
Emperor Alexius Comnenus (1081-1118) put forth every effort to expel
the intruders from Asia Minor, hoping to be able to regain the territories,
including Syria, which they had stripped from the Empire; but his
strength proved unequal to the task. Accordingly, in 1095, he sent an
appeal to Pope Urban II. to enlist the Christian world in a united effort
to save both the Empire and the Eastern Church. It used to be thought
that Pope Sylvester II., about the year 1000, had suggested a crusade
against the Mohammedans of the East, but it now appears that the first
pope to advance such an idea was Gregory VII. (1073-1085), who in
response to an appeal of Alexius's predecessor in 1074, had actually assembled
an army of 50,000 men for the aid of the Emperor and had been
prevented from carrying out the project only by the severity of the
investiture controversy with Henry IV. of Germany. At any rate, it was
not a difficult task for the ambassadors of Alexius to convince Pope
Urban that he ought to execute the plan of Gregory. The plea for aid
was made at the Council of Piacenza in March, 1095, and during the next
few months Urban thought out the best method of procedure.</p>

<p>At the Council of Clermont, held in November, 1095, the crusade was
formally proclaimed through the famous speech which the Pope himself
delivered after the regular business of the assembly had been transacted.
Urban was a Frenchman and he knew how to appeal to the emotions and
sympathies of his hearers. For the purpose of stirring up interest in the
enterprise he dropped the Latin in which the work of the Council had
been transacted and broke forth in his native tongue, much to the delight
of his countrymen. There are four early versions of the speech,
differing widely in contents, and none, of course, reproducing the exact
words used by the speaker. The version given by Robert the Monk, a
resident of Rheims, in the opening chapter of his history of the first
crusade seems in most respects superior to the others. It was written
nearly a quarter of a century after the Council of Clermont, but the
writer in all probability had at least heard the speech which he was trying
to reproduce; in any event we may take his version of it as a very
satisfactory representation of the aspirations and spirit which impelled
the first crusaders to their great enterprise. It has been well said that
"many orations have been delivered with as much eloquence, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
as fiery words as the Pope used, but no other oration has ever been able
to boast of as wonderful results."</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord's Incarnation one thousand and
ninety-five, a great council was convened within the bounds of
<span class="sidebar">The Council
of Clermont</span>
Gaul, in Auvergne, in the city which is called
Clermont. Over this Pope Urban II. presided,
with the Roman bishops and cardinals. This council was a
famous one on account of the concourse of both French and
German bishops, and of princes as well. Having arranged the
matters relating to the Church, the lord Pope went forth into a
certain spacious plain, for no building was large enough to hold
all the people. The Pope then, with sweet and persuasive eloquence,
addressed those present in words something like the
following, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, race of Franks, race beyond the mountains [the Alps],
race beloved and chosen by God (as is clear from many of your
works), set apart from all other nations by the situation of your
<span class="sidebar">Pope Urban
appeals to the
French</span>
country, as well as by your Catholic faith and
the honor you render to the holy Church: to you
our discourse is addressed, and for you our
exhortations are intended. We wish you to know what a serious
matter has led us to your country, for it is the imminent peril
threatening you and all the faithful that has brought us hither.</p>

<p>"From the confines of Jerusalem and from the city of Constantinople
a grievous report has gone forth and has been brought
repeatedly to our ears; namely, that a race from the kingdom
of the Persians, an accursed race, a race wholly alienated from
God, 'a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose
spirit was not steadfast with God' [Ps., lxxviii. 8], has violently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated
them by pillage and fire. They have led away a part of the
<span class="sidebar">The ravages
of the Turks</span>
captives into their own country, and a part they
have killed by cruel tortures. They have either
destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites
of their own religion. They destroy the altars, after having
defiled them with their uncleanness.... The kingdom of
the Greeks [the Eastern Empire] is now dismembered by them
and has been deprived of territory so vast in extent that it could
not be traversed in two months' time.</p>

<p>"On whom, therefore, rests the labor of avenging these wrongs
and of recovering this territory, if not upon you&mdash;you, upon
whom, above all other nations, God has conferred remarkable
glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to
humble the heads of those who resist you? Let the deeds of
your ancestors encourage you and incite your minds to manly
<span class="sidebar">Urban recalls
the zeal and
valor of the
earlier Franks</span>
achievements&mdash;the glory and greatness of King
Charlemagne, and of his son Louis [the Pious],
and of your other monarchs, who have destroyed
the kingdoms of the Turks<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> and have extended the sway of the
holy Church over lands previously pagan. Let the holy sepulcher
of our Lord and Saviour, which is possessed by the unclean
nations, especially arouse you, and the holy places which are
now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with the
filth of the unclean. Oh most valiant soldiers and descendants
of invincible ancestors, do not degenerate, but recall the valor of
your ancestors.</p>

<p>"But if you are hindered by love of children, parents, or wife,
remember what the Lord says in the Gospel, 'He that loveth
father or mother more than me is not worthy of me' [Matt.,
x. 37]. 'Every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for
my name's sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit
everlasting life' [Matt., xix. 29]. Let none of your possessions
restrain you, nor anxiety for your family affairs. For this land
which you inhabit, shut in on all sides by the seas and surrounded
<span class="sidebar">The crusade as
a desirable remedy
for over
population</span>
by the mountain peaks, is too narrow
for your large population; nor does it abound in
wealth; and it furnishes scarcely food enough
for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour
one another, that you wage war, and that very many among you
perish in civil strife.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>"Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels
end; let wars cease; and let all dissensions and controversies
slumber. Enter upon the road of the Holy Sepulcher; wrest that
land from the wicked race, and subject it to yourselves. That
land which, as the Scripture says, 'floweth with
<span class="sidebar">Syria, a rich
country</span>
milk and honey' [Num., xiii. 27] was given by
God into the power of the children of Israel. Jerusalem is the
center of the earth; the land is fruitful above all others, like
another paradise of delights. This spot the Redeemer of mankind
has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by His
sojourn, has consecrated by His passion, has redeemed by His
death, has glorified by His burial.</p>

<p>"This royal city, however, situated at the center of the earth,
is now held captive by the enemies of Christ and is subjected,
by those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathen.
She seeks, therefore, and desires to be liberated, and ceases not to
implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks
succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
upon you, above all other nations, great glory in arms. Accordingly,
undertake this journey eagerly for the remission of your
sins, with the assurance of the reward of imperishable glory in
the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>When Pope Urban had skilfully said these and very many
similar things, he so centered in one purpose the desires of all
<span class="sidebar">Response to
the appeal</span>
who were present that all cried out, "It is the
will of God! It is the will of God!" When the
venerable Roman pontiff heard that, with eyes uplifted to heaven,
he gave thanks to God and, commanding silence with his hand, said:</p>

<p>"Most beloved brethren, to-day is manifest in you what the
Lord says in the Gospel, 'Where two or three are gathered together
in my name, there am I in the midst of them' [Matt.,
xviii. 20]. For unless God had been present in your spirits, all
of you would not have uttered the same cry; since, although
<span class="sidebar">"Deus vult,"
the war cry</span>
the cry issued from numerous mouths, yet the
origin of the cry was one. Therefore I say to you
that God, who implanted this in your breasts, has drawn it forth
from you. Let that, then, be your war cry in battle, because it
is given to you by God. When an armed attack is made upon
the enemy, let this one cry be raised by all the soldiers of God:
'It is the will of God! It is the will of God!'</p>

<p>"And we neither command nor advise that the old or feeble,
or those incapable of bearing arms, undertake this journey.
Nor ought women to set out at all without their husbands, or
brothers, or legal guardians. For such are more of a hindrance
than aid, more of a burden than an advantage. Let the rich
aid the needy; and according to their wealth let them take with
them experienced soldiers. The priests and other clerks [clergy],
<span class="sidebar">Who should go
and who should
remain</span>
whether secular or regular, are not to go without
the consent of their bishop; for this journey
would profit them nothing if they went without
permission. Also, it is not fitting that laymen should enter upon
the pilgrimage without the blessing of their priests.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>"Whoever, therefore, shall decide upon this holy pilgrimage,
and shall make his vow to God to that effect, and shall offer
himself to Him for sacrifice, as a living victim, holy and acceptable
to God, shall wear the sign of the cross of the Lord on his forehead
or on his breast. When he shall return from his journey,
having fulfilled his vow, let him place the cross on his back
between his shoulders. Thus shall ye, indeed, by this twofold
action, fulfill the precept of the Lord, as He commands in the
Gospel, 'He that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me,
is not worthy of me'" [Luke, xiv. 27].</p>

<h4>52. The Starting of the Crusaders (1096)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The appeals of Pope Urban at Clermont and elsewhere met with ready
response, especially among the French, but also to a considerable extent
among Italians, Germans, and even English. A great variety of people
were attracted by the enterprise, and from an equal variety of motives.
Men whose lives had been evil saw in the crusade an opportunity of
doing penance; criminals who perhaps cared little for penance but much
for their own personal safety saw in it an avenue of escape from justice;
merchants discovered in it a chance to open up new and valuable trade;
knights hailed it as an invitation to deeds of valor and glory surpassing
any Europe had yet known; ordinary malcontents regarded it as a chance
to mend their fortunes; and a very large number of people looked upon
it as a great spiritual obligation laid upon them and necessary to be
performed in order to insure salvation in the world to come. By reason
of all these incentives, some of them weighing much more in the mediæval
mind than we can understand to-day, the crusade brought together men,
women, and children from every part of Christendom. Both of the
accounts given below of the assembling and starting of the crusaders
are doubtless more or less exaggerated at certain points, yet in substance
they represent what must have been pretty nearly the actual facts.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury was an English monk who lived in the first
half of the twelfth century and wrote a very valuable <i>Chronicle of the
Kings of England</i>, which reached the opening of the reign of Stephen
(1135). He thus had abundant opportunity to learn of the first crusade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
from people who had actually participated in it. His rather humorous
picture of the effects of Pope Urban's call is thus well worth reading.
Better than it, however, is the account by the priest Fulcher of Chartres
(1058-1124)&mdash;better because the writer himself took part in the crusade
and so was a personal observer of most of the things he undertook
to describe. Fulcher, in 1096, set out upon the crusade in the company
of his lord, Etienne, count of Blois and Chartres, who was a man of
importance in the army of Robert of Normandy. With the rest of Robert's
crusaders he spent the winter in Italy and arrived at Durazzo in
the spring of 1097. He had a part in the siege of Nicæa and in the battle
of Dorylæum, but not in the siege of Antioch. Before reaching Jerusalem,
in 1099, he became chaplain to a brother of Godfrey of Bouillon
and was already making progress on his "history of the army of God."</p>

<p>Immediately the fame of this great event,<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> being spread
through the universe, penetrated the minds of Christians with
its mild breath, and wherever it blew there was no nation, however
distant and obscure, that did not send some of its people.
This zeal animated not only the provinces bordering on the
Mediterranean, but all who had ever even heard of the name
Christian in the most remote isles, and among barbarous nations.
Then the Welshman abandoned his forests and neglected his
hunting; the Scotchman deserted the fleas with which he is so
<span class="sidebar">Universal interest
in the
crusade</span>
familiar; the Dane ceased to swallow his intoxicating
draughts; and the Norwegian turned his
back upon his raw fish. The fields were left by
the cultivators, and the houses by their inhabitants; all the cities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
were deserted. People were restrained neither by the ties of
blood nor the love of country; they saw nothing but God. All
that was in the granaries, or was destined for food, was left
under the guardianship of the greedy agriculturist. The journey
to Jerusalem was the only thing hoped for or thought of. Joy
animated the hearts of all who set out; grief dwelt in the hearts
of all who remained. Why do I say "of those who remained"?
You might have seen the husband setting forth with his wife,
with all his family; you would have laughed to see all the <i>penates</i><a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
put in motion and loaded upon wagons. The road was too
narrow for the passengers, and more room was wanted for the
travelers, so great and numerous was the crowd.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p class="center">(b)</p>

<p>Such, then, was the immense assemblage which set out from
the West. Gradually along the march, and from day to day, the
army grew by the addition of other armies, coming from every
direction and composed of innumerable people. Thus one saw
an infinite multitude, speaking different languages and coming
from divers countries. All did not, however, come together into
<span class="sidebar">The multitude
of crusaders</span>
a single army until we had reached the city of
Nicæa.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> What shall I add? The isles of the sea
and the kingdoms of the whole earth were moved by God, so
that one might believe fulfilled the prophecy of David, who said
in his Psalm: "All nations whom Thou hast made shall come
and worship before Thee, O Lord, and shall glorify Thy name;"
and so that those who reached the holy places afterwards said
justly: "We will worship where His feet have stood." Concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
this journey we read very many other predictions in the
prophets, which it would be tedious to recall.</p>

<p>Oh, how great was the grief, how deep the sighs, what weeping,
what lamentations among the friends, when the husband
left the wife so dear to him, his children also, and all his possessions
of any kind, father, mother, brethren, or kindred! And
<span class="sidebar">Mingled sorrow
and joy of
the crusaders</span>
yet in spite of the floods of tears which those
who remained shed for their friends about to
depart, and in their very presence, the latter did
not suffer their courage to fail, and, out of love for the Lord, in
no way hesitated to leave all that they held most precious, believing
without doubt that they would gain an hundred-fold
in receiving the recompense which God has promised to those
who love Him.</p>

<p>Then the husband confided to his wife the time of his return
and assured her that, if he lived, by God's grace he would return
to her. He commended her to the Lord, gave her a kiss, and,
weeping, promised to return. But the latter, who feared that
she would never see him again, overcome with grief, was unable
to stand, fell as if lifeless to the ground, and wept over her dear
one whom she was losing in life, as if he were already dead.
He, then, as if he had no pity (nevertheless he was filled with
pity) and was not moved by the grief of his friends (and yet he
was secretly moved), departed with a firm purpose. The sadness
was for those who remained, and the joy for those who departed.
What more can we say? "This is the Lord's doings, and it is
marvelous in our eyes."</p>

<h4>53. A Letter from a Crusader to his Wife</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>One of the most important groups of sources on the crusades is the
large body of letters which has come down to us, written by men who
had an actual part in the various expeditions. These letters, addressed
to parents, wives, children, vassals, or friends, are valuable alike for
the facts which they contain and for the revelation they give of the spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
and motives of the crusaders. A considerable collection of the letters,
in English translation, may be found in Roger de Hoveden's <i>Annals of
English History</i>, Roger of Wendover's <i>Flowers of History</i>, and Matthew
Paris's <i>English History</i> (all in the Bohn Library); also in Michaud's
<i>History of the Crusades</i>, Vol. III., Appendix. In many respects the letter
given below, written at Antioch by Count Stephen of Blois to his wife
Adele, under date of March 29, 1098, is unexcelled in all the records of
mediæval letter-writing. Count Stephen (a brother-in-law of Robert
of Normandy, who was a son of William the Conqueror) was one of the
wealthiest and most popular French noblemen who responded to Pope
Urban's summons at Clermont. At least three of his letters to his wife
survive, of which the one here given is the third in order of time.
It discloses the ordinary human sentiments of the crusader and makes
us feel that, unlike the modern man as he was, he yet had very much
in common with the people of to-day and of all ages. He was at the
same time a bold fighter and a tender husband, a religious enthusiast
and a practical man of affairs. When the letter was written, the siege
of Antioch had been in progress somewhat more than five months; it
continued until the following June, when it ended in the capture of the
city by the crusaders. Count Stephen was slain in the battle of Ramleh
in 1102.</p>

Pa. Translations and Reprints</i>, Vol. I., No. 4, pp. 5-8.</p>

<p>Count Stephen to Adele, his sweetest and most amiable wife,
to his dear children, and to all his vassals of all ranks,&mdash;his
greeting and blessing.</p>

<p>You may be very sure, dearest, that the messenger whom I
sent to give you pleasure left me before Antioch safe and unharmed
and, through God's grace, in the greatest prosperity.
And already at that time, together with all the chosen army of
<span class="sidebar">Count Stephen
reports prosperity</span>
Christ, endowed with great valor by Him, we
have been continually advancing for twenty-three
weeks toward the home of our Lord Jesus. You
may know for certain, my beloved, that of gold, silver, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
many other kind of riches I now have twice as much as your
love had assigned to me when I left you. For all our princes,
with the common consent of the whole army, though against my
own wishes, have made me up to the present time the leader,
chief, and director of their whole expedition.</p>

<p>Doubtless you have heard that after the capture of the city
of Nicæa we fought a great battle with the treacherous Turks
and, by God's aid, conquered them.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Next we conquered for the
Lord all Romania, and afterwards Cappadocia.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> We had learned
that there was a certain Turkish prince, Assam, dwelling in
Cappadocia; so we directed our course thither. We conquered
<span class="sidebar">Early achievements
of the
crusaders</span>
all his castles by force and compelled him to flee
to a certain very strong castle situated on a high
rock. We also gave the land of that Assam to
one of our chiefs, and in order that he might conquer the prince
we left there with him many soldiers of Christ. Thence, continually
following the wicked Turks, we drove them through the
midst of Armenia,<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> as far as the great river Euphrates. Having
left all their baggage and beasts of burden on the bank, they fled
across the river into Arabia.</p>

<p>The bolder of the Turkish soldiers, indeed, entering Syria,
hastened by forced marches night and day, in order to be able
to enter the royal city of Antioch before our approach.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Hearing
of this, the whole army of God gave due praise and thanks
to the all-powerful Lord. Hastening with great joy to this
<span class="sidebar">The arrival at
Antioch (1097)</span>
chief city of Antioch, we besieged it and there
had a great number of conflicts with the Turks;
and seven times we fought with the citizens of the city and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
the innumerable troops all the time coming to their aid. The latter
we rushed out to meet and fought with the fiercest courage
under the leadership of Christ. And in all these seven battles,
by the aid of the Lord God, we conquered and most assuredly
killed an innumerable host of them. In those battles, indeed,
and in very many attacks made upon the city, many of our
brethren and followers were killed and their souls were borne to
the joys of paradise.</p>

<p>We found the city of Antioch very extensive, fortified with the
greatest strength and almost impossible to be taken. In addition,
more than 5,000 bold Turkish soldiers had entered the city,
not counting the Saracens, Publicans, Arabs, Turcopolitans,
Syrians, Armenians, and other different races of whom an infinite
multitude had gathered together there. In fighting against
<span class="sidebar">The beginning
of the siege</span>
these enemies of God and of us we have, by God's
grace, endured many sufferings and innumerable
hardships up to the present time. Many also have already
exhausted all their means in this most holy enterprise. Very
many of our Franks, indeed, would have met a bodily death
from starvation, if the mercy of God and our money had not
come to their rescue. Lying before the city of Antioch, indeed,
throughout the whole winter we suffered for our Lord Christ
from excessive cold and enormous torrents of rain. What some
say about the impossibility of bearing the heat of the sun in
Syria is untrue, for the winter there is very similar to our winter
in the West.</p>

<p>I delight to tell you, dearest, what happened to us during Lent.
Our princes had caused a fortress to be built before a certain
gate which was between our camp and the sea. For the Turks,
coming out of this gate daily, killed some of our men on their
way to the sea. The city of Antioch is about five leagues distant
from the sea. For this purpose they sent the excellent Bohemond
and Raymond, count of St. Gilles,<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> to the sea with only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
sixty horsemen, in order that they might bring mariners to aid
in this work. When, however, they were returning to us with
<span class="sidebar">The Christians
defeated near
the seashore</span>
these mariners, the Turks collected an army, fell
suddenly upon our two leaders, and forced them
to a perilous flight. In that unexpected fight we
lost more than 500 of our foot-soldiers&mdash;to the glory of God.
Of our horsemen, however, we lost only two, for certain.</p>

<p>On that same day, in order to receive our brethren with joy,
and entirely ignorant of their misfortunes, we went out to meet
them. When, however, we approached the above-mentioned
gate of the city, a mob of foot-soldiers and horsemen from
Antioch, elated by the victory which they had won, rushed upon
us in the same manner. Seeing these, our leaders went to the
camp of the Christians to order all to be ready to follow us into
battle. In the meantime our men gathered together and the
scattered leaders, namely, Bohemond and Raymond, with the
remainder of their army came up and told of the great misfortune
which they had suffered.</p>

<p>Our men, full of fury at these most evil tidings, prepared to
die for Christ and, deeply grieved for their brethren, rushed upon
the wicked Turks. They, enemies of God and of us, hastily fled
before us and attempted to enter the city. But by God's grace
the affair turned out very differently; for, when they tried to
cross a bridge built over the great river Moscholum,<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
<span class="sidebar">A notable victory
over the
Turks</span>
we followed them as closely as possible,
killed many before they reached the bridge,
forced many into the river, all of whom were killed, and we also
slew many upon the bridge and very many at the narrow entrance
to the gate. I am telling you the truth, my beloved,
and you may be assured that in this battle we killed thirty
emirs, that is, princes, and three hundred other Turkish nobles,
not counting the remaining Turks and pagans. Indeed the number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
of Turks and Saracens killed is reckoned at 1230, but of
ours we did not lose a single man.</p>

<p>On the following day (Easter), while my chaplain Alexander
was writing this letter in great haste, a party of our men lying
in wait for the Turks fought a successful battle with them and
killed sixty horsemen, whose heads they brought to the army.</p>

<p>These which I write to you are only a few things, dearest, of
the many which we have done; and because I am not able to tell
you, dearest, what is in my mind, I charge you to do right, to
watch carefully over your land, and to do your duty as you
ought to your children and your vassals. You will certainly see
me just as soon as I can possibly return to you. Farewell.</p>

<h4>54. The Winning of the Charter</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The reign of King John (1199-1216) was an era of humiliation,
though in the end one of triumph, for all classes of the English people.
The king himself was perhaps the most unworthy sovereign who has
ever occupied the English throne and one after another of his deeds
and policies brought deep shame to every patriotic Englishman. His
surrender to the papacy (1213) and his loss of the English possessions
on the continent (1214) were only two of the most conspicuous results
of his weakness and mismanagement. Indeed it was not these that
touched the English people most closely, for after all it was rather their
pride than their real interests that suffered by the king's homage to
Innocent III. and his bitter defeat at Bouvines. Worse than these
things were the heavy taxes and the illegal extortions of money, in
which John went far beyond even his unscrupulous brother and predecessor,
Richard. The king's expenses were very heavy, the more so by
reason of his French wars, and to meet them he devised all manner of
schemes for wringing money from his unwilling subjects. Land taxes
were increased, scutage (payments in lieu of military service) was nearly
doubled, levies of a thirteenth, a seventh, and other large fractions of
the movable property of the realm were made, excessive fines were
imposed, old feudal rights were revived and exercised in an arbitrary
fashion, and property was confiscated on the shallowest of pretenses.
Even the Church was by no means immune from the king's rapacity.
The result of these high-handed measures was that all classes of the
people&mdash;barons, clergy, and commons&mdash;were driven into an attitude
of open protest. The leadership against the king fell naturally to the
barons and it was directly in consequence of their action that John was
brought, in 1215, to grant the Great Charter and to pledge himself to
govern thereafter according to the ancient and just laws of the kingdom.

<p>The account of the winning of the Charter given below comes from
the hand of Roger of Wendover, a monk of St. Albans, a monastery in
Hertfordshire which was famous in the thirteenth century for its group
of historians and annalists. It begins with the meeting of the barons at
St. Edmunds in Suffolk late in November, 1214, and tells the story to
the granting of the Charter at Runnymede, June 15, 1215. On this subject,
as well as on the entire period of English history from 1189 to
1235, Roger of Wendover is our principal contemporary authority.</p>

Book which is called the Flowers of History"]. Translated by
J. A. Giles (London, 1849), Vol. II., pp. 303-324 <i>passim</i>.</p>

<p>About this time the earls and barons of England assembled
at St. Edmunds, as if for religious duties, although it was
for another reason;<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> for after they had discoursed together
secretly for a time, there was placed before them the charter of
King Henry the First, which they had received, as mentioned
before, in the city of London from Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
This charter contained certain liberties and laws granted
to the holy Church as well as to the nobles of the kingdom, besides
some liberties which the king added of his own accord.
All therefore assembled in the church of St. Edmund, the king
and martyr, and, commencing with those of the highest rank,
they all swore on the great altar that, if the king refused to
<span class="sidebar">A conference
held by the
barons against
King John</span>
grant these liberties and laws, they themselves
would withdraw from their allegiance to him,
and make war on him until he should, by a
charter under his own seal, confirm to them everything that they
required; and finally it was unanimously agreed that, after
Christmas, they should all go together to the king and demand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
the confirmation of the aforesaid liberties to them, and that
they should in the meantime provide themselves with horses
and arms, so that if the king should endeavor to depart from
his oath they might, by taking his castles, compel him to satisfy
their demands; and having arranged this, each man returned
home....</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord 1215, which was the seventeenth year
of the reign of King John, he held his court at Winchester at
Christmas for one day, after which he hurried to London, and
<span class="sidebar">They demand
a confirmation
of the old liberties</span>
took up his abode at the New Temple;<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and at
that place the above-mentioned nobles came to
him in gay military array, and demanded the
confirmation of the liberties and laws of King Edward, with
other liberties granted to them and to the kingdom and church
of England, as were contained in the charter, and above-mentioned
laws of Henry the First. They also asserted that, at the
time of his absolution at Winchester,<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> he had promised to restore
those laws and ancient liberties, and was bound by his
own oath to observe them. The king, hearing the bold tone of
the barons in making this demand, much feared an attack from
them, as he saw that they were prepared for battle. He, however,
made answer that their demands were a matter of importance
<span class="sidebar">A truce
arranged</span>
and difficulty, and he therefore asked
a truce until the end of Easter, that, after due
deliberation, he might be able to satisfy them as well as the
dignity of his crown. After much discussion on both sides, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
king at length, although unwillingly, procured the archbishop of
Canterbury, the bishop of Ely, and William Marshal, as his sureties
that on the day agreed upon he would, in all reason, satisfy
them all; on which the nobles returned to their homes. The king,
however, wishing to take precautions against the future, caused
all the nobles throughout England to swear fealty to him alone
against all men, and to renew their homage to him; and, the
better to take care of himself, on the day of St. Mary's purification,
he assumed the cross of our Lord, being induced to this
more by fear than devotion....<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>In Easter week of this same year, the above-mentioned nobles
assembled at Stamford,<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> with horses and arms. They had now
<span class="sidebar">The truce
at an end</span>
induced almost all the nobility of the whole kingdom
to join them, and constituted a very large
army; for in their army there were computed to be two thousand
knights, besides horse-soldiers, attendants, and foot-soldiers, who
were variously equipped.... The king at this time was
awaiting the arrival of his nobles at Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> On the Monday
next after the octave of Easter,<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> the said barons assembled in the
town of Brackley.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> And when the king learned this, he sent the
archbishop of Canterbury and William Marshal, earl of Pembroke,
with some other prudent men, to them to inquire what the laws
<span class="sidebar">The preliminary
demands
of the barons</span>
and liberties were which they demanded. The
barons then delivered to the messengers a paper,
containing in great measure the laws and ancient
customs of the kingdom, and declared that, unless the king immediately
granted them and confirmed them under his own seal, they,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
by taking possession of his fortresses, would force him to give them
sufficient satisfaction as to their before-named demands. The
archbishop, with his fellow messengers, then carried the paper
to the king, and read to him the heads of the paper one by one
throughout. The king, when he heard the purport of these
heads, said derisively, with the greatest indignation, "Why,
amongst these unjust demands, did not the barons ask for my
kingdom also? Their demands are vain and visionary, and are
unsupported by any plea of reason whatever." And at length
he angrily declared with an oath that he would never grant
them such liberties as would render him their slave. The principal
of these laws and liberties which the nobles required to be
confirmed to them are partly described above in the charter of
King Henry,<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and partly are extracted from the old laws of
King Edward,<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> as the following history will show in due time.</p>

<p>As the archbishop and William Marshal could not by any
persuasion induce the king to agree to their demands, they
<span class="sidebar">The castle of
Northampton
besieged by
the barons</span>
returned by the king's order to the barons, and
duly reported to them all that they had heard from
the king. And when the nobles heard what John
said, they appointed Robert Fitz-Walter commander of their
soldiers, giving him the title of "Marshal of the Army of God
and the Holy Church," and then, one and all flying to arms, they
directed their forces toward Northampton.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> On their arrival
there they at once laid siege to the castle, but after having stayed
there for fifteen days, and having gained little or no advantage,
they determined to move their camp. Having come without
<i>petrariæ</i><a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> and other engines of war, they, without accomplishing
their purpose, proceeded in confusion to the castle of Bedford....<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>When the army of the barons arrived at Bedford, they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
received with all respect by William de Beauchamp.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Messengers
from the city of London also came to them there, secretly
telling them, if they wished to get into that city, to come there
immediately. The barons, encouraged by the arrival of this
agreeable message, immediately moved their camp and arrived
<span class="sidebar">The city of
London given
over to the
barons</span>
at Ware. After this they marched the whole
night and arrived early in the morning at the city
of London, and, finding the gates open, on the
24th of May (which was the Sunday next before our Lord's
ascension) they entered the city without any tumult while the
inhabitants were performing divine service; for the rich citizens
were favorable to the barons, and the poor ones were afraid to
murmur against them. The barons, having thus got into the city,
placed their own guards in charge of each of the gates, and then
arranged all matters in the city at will.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> They then took security
from the citizens, and sent letters through England to those
earls, barons, and knights who appeared to be still faithful to
the king (though they only pretended to be so) and advised them
with threats, as they had regard for the safety of all their property
and possessions, to abandon a king who was perjured and
who made war against his barons, and together with them to
stand firm and fight against the king for their rights and for
peace; and that, if they refused to do this, they, the barons,
would make war against them all, as against open enemies, and
would destroy their castles, burn their houses and other buildings,
and pillage their warrens, parks, and orchards....
The greatest part of these, on receiving the message of the
barons, set out to London and joined them, abandoning the
king entirely....</p>

<p>King John, when he saw that he was deserted by almost all,
so that out of his regal superabundance of followers he retained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
scarcely seven knights, was much alarmed lest the barons should
attack his castles and reduce them without difficulty, as they
<span class="sidebar">The conference
between the
king and the
barons</span>
would find no obstacle to their so doing. He
deceitfully pretended to make peace for a time
with the aforesaid barons, and sent William
Marshal, earl of Pembroke, with other trustworthy messengers,
to them, and told them that, for the sake of peace and for the
exaltation and honor of the kingdom, he would willingly grant
them the laws and liberties they demanded. He sent also a request
to the barons by these same messengers that they appoint
a suitable day and place to meet and carry all these matters into
effect. The king's messengers then came in all haste to London,
and without deceit, reported to the barons all that had been deceitfully
imposed on them. They in their great joy appointed
the fifteenth of June for the king to meet them, at a field lying
<span class="sidebar">The charter
granted at
Runnymede</span>
between Staines and Windsor.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Accordingly, at
the time and place agreed upon the king and nobles
came to the appointed conference, and when each
party had stationed itself some distance from the other, they
began a long discussion about terms of peace and the aforesaid
liberties.... At length, after various points on both sides
had been discussed, King John, seeing that he was inferior in
strength to the barons, without raising any difficulty, granted the
underwritten laws and liberties, and confirmed them by his charter
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>[Here ensues the Charter.]</p>

<h4>55. Extracts from the Charter</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>No document in the history of any nation is more important than the
Great Charter; in the words of Bishop Stubbs, the whole of the constitutional
history of England is only one long commentary upon it. Its
importance lay not merely in the fact that it was won from an unwilling
sovereign by the united action of nobles, clergy, and people, but also in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
the admirable summary which it embodies of the fundamental principles
of English government, so far as they had ripened by the early years of
the thirteenth century. The charter contained almost nothing that
was not old. It was not even an instrument, like the Constitution of the
United States, providing for the creation of a new government. It
merely sought to gather up within a single reasonably brief document all
the important principles which the best of the English sovereigns had
recognized, but which such rulers as Richard and John had lately been
improving every opportunity to evade. The primary purpose of the
barons in forcing the king to grant the charter was not to get a new
form of government or code of laws, but simply to obtain a remedy
for certain concrete abuses, to resist the encroachments of the crown
upon the traditional liberties of Englishmen, and to get a full and definite
confirmation of these liberties in black and white. Not a new constitution
was wanted, but good government in conformity with the old
one. Naturally enough, therefore, the charter of 1215 was based in
most of its important provisions upon that granted by Henry I. in 1100,
even as this one was based on the righteous laws of the good Edward
the Confessor. And after the same manner the charter of King John, in
its turn, became the foundation for all future resistance of Englishmen
to the evils of misgovernment, so that very soon it came naturally
to be called <i>Magna Charta</i>&mdash;the Great Charter&mdash;by which designation
it is known to this day.</p>

<p>King John was in no true sense the author of the charter. Many
weeks before the meeting at Runnymede the barons had drawn up their
demands in written form, and when that meeting occurred they were
ready to lay before the sovereign a formal document, in forty-nine
chapters, to which they simply requested his assent. This preliminary
document was discussed and worked over, the number of chapters
being increased to sixty-two, but the charter as finally agreed upon
differed from it only in minor details. It is a mistake to think of John
as "signing" the charter after the fashion of modern sovereigns. There
is no evidence that he could write, and at any rate he acquiesced in the
terms of the charter only by having his seal affixed to the paper. The
original "Articles of the Barons" is still preserved in the British Museum,
but there is no <i>one</i> original Magna Charta in existence. Duplicate copies
of the document were made for distribution among the barons, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
papers which are generally supposed to represent four of these still
exist, two being in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The charter makes a lengthy document and many parts of it are too
technical to be of service in this book; hence only a few of the most important
chapters are here given. Translations of the entire document
from the original Latin may be found in many places, among them the

<p>John, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland,
duke of Normandy, Aquitane, and count of Anjou, to his archbishops,
bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciaries, foresters,
sheriffs, governors, officers, and to all bailiffs, and his faithful

and for the salvation of our soul, and the souls of all our ancestors
and heirs, and unto the honor of God and the advancement
of Holy Church, and amendment of our Realm, ...
have, in the first place, granted to God, and by this our present
Charter confirmed, for us and our heirs forever:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> That the Church of England shall be free, and have her
whole rights, and her liberties inviolable; and we will have them
<span class="sidebar">Liberties of the
English Church
guaranteed</span>
so observed that it may appear thence that the freedom
of elections, which is reckoned chief and indispensable
to the English Church, and which we
granted and confirmed by our Charter, and obtained the confirmation
of the same from our Lord Pope Innocent III., before
the discord between us and our barons, was granted of
mere free will; which Charter we shall observe, and we do desire
it to be faithfully observed by our heirs forever.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p><b>2.</b> We also have granted to all the freemen of our kingdom,
for us and for our heirs forever, all the underwritten liberties,
to be had and holden by them and their heirs, of us and our
heirs forever. If any of our earls, or barons, or others who hold
of us in chief by military service,<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> shall die, and at the time of his

death his heir shall be of full age, and owe a relief,
he shall have his inheritance by the ancient
relief&mdash;that is to say, the heir or heirs of an earl, for a whole
earldom, by a hundred pounds; the heir or heirs of a knight, for
a whole knight's fee, by a hundred shillings at most; and whoever
oweth less shall give less, according to the ancient custom
of fees.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p><b>3.</b> But if the heir of any such shall be under age, and shall
be in ward, when he comes of age he shall have his inheritance
without relief and without fine.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p><b>12.</b> No scutage<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> or aid shall be imposed in our kingdom, unless

manner it shall be concerning the aids of the City of London.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p><b>14.</b> And for holding the general council of the kingdom concerning
the assessment of aids, except in the three cases aforesaid,
and for the assessing of scutage, we shall cause to be summoned
the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons
of the realm, singly by our letters. And furthermore, we shall
<span class="sidebar">The Great
Council</span>
cause to be summoned generally, by our sheriffs
and bailiffs, all others who hold of us in chief, for
a certain day, that is to say, forty days before their meeting at
least, and to a certain place. And in all letters of such summons
we will declare the cause of such summons. And summons being
thus made, the business shall proceed on the day appointed,
according to the advice of such as shall be present, although all

to make his eldest son a knight, and once to marry his eldest
daughter; and for this there shall be paid only a reasonable

<p><b>41.</b> All merchants shall have safe and secure conduct to go
out of, and to come into, England, and to stay there and to pass
as well by land as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient

<span class="sidebar">Freedom of

of war, or when they are of any nation at war
with us. And if there be found any such in our
land, in the beginning of the war, they shall be
detained, without damage to their bodies or goods, until it be
known to us, or to our chief justiciary, how our merchants be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
treated in the nation at war with us; and if ours be safe there,
the others shall be safe in our dominions.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p><b>42.</b> It shall be lawful, for the time to come, for any one to go
out of our kingdom and return safely and securely by land or
by water, saving his allegiance to us (unless in time of war, by
some short space, for the common benefit of the realm), except
prisoners and outlaws, according to the law of the land, and
people in war with us, and merchants who shall be treated as is
above mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

granted to be holden in our kingdom, as much as it belongs to
us, all people of our kingdom, as well clergy as laity, shall observe,
as far as they are concerned, towards their dependents.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p><b>61.</b> And whereas, for the honor of God and the amendment
of our kingdom, and for the better quieting the discord that
<span class="sidebar">How the charter
was to be
enforced</span>
has arisen between us and our barons, we have
granted all these things aforesaid. Willing to
render them firm and lasting, we do give and grant
our subjects the underwritten security, namely, that the barons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
may choose five and twenty barons of the kingdom, whom they

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
THE REIGN OF SAINT LOUIS</h3>

<div class="intro">
<h4>56. The Character and Deeds of the King as Described by Joinville</h4>

<p>Louis IX., or St. Louis, as he is commonly called, was the eldest son
of Louis VIII. and a grandson of Philip Augustus. He was born in 1214
and upon the death of his father in 1226 he succeeded to the throne of
France while yet but a boy of twelve. The recent reign of Philip Augustus
(1180-1223) had been a period marked by a great increase in
the royal power and by a corresponding lessening of the independent
authority of the feudal magnates. The accession of a boy-king was
therefore hailed by the discontented nobles as an opportunity to recover
something at least of their lost privileges. It would doubtless have been
such but for the vigilance, ability, and masculine aggressiveness of the
young king's mother, Blanche of Castile. Aided by the clergy and the
loyal party among the nobles, she, in the capacity of regent, successfully
defended her son's interests against a succession of plots and uprisings,
with the result that when Louis gradually assumed control of affairs in
his own name, about 1236, the realm was in good order and the dangers
which once had been so threatening had all but disappeared. The king's
education and moral training had been well attended to, and he arrived
at manhood with an equipment quite unusual among princes of his day.
His reign extended to 1270 and became in some respects the most notable
in all French history. In fact, whether viewed from the standpoint of
his personal character or his practical achievements, St. Louis is
generally admitted to have been one of the most remarkable sovereigns
of mediæval Europe. He was famous throughout Christendom for his
piety, justice, wisdom, and ability, being recognized as at once a devoted
monk, a brave knight, and a capable king. In him were blended two
qualities&mdash;vigorous activity and proneness to austere meditation&mdash;rarely
combined in such measure in one person. His character may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
be summed up by saying that he had all the virtues of his age and few
of its vices. No less cynical a critic than Voltaire has declared that he
went as far in goodness as it is possible for a man to go.</p>

<p>Saint Louis being thus so interesting a character in himself, it is very
fortunate that we have an excellent contemporary biography of him,
from the hand of a friend and companion who knew him well. Sire de
Joinville's <i>Histoire de Saint Louis</i> is a classic of French literature and
in most respects the best piece of biographical writing that has come
down to us from the Middle Ages. Joinville, or more properly John,
lord of Joinville, was born in Champagne, in northern France, probably
in 1225. His family was one of the most distinguished in Champagne
and he himself had all the advantages that could come from being
brought up at the refined court of the count of this favored district. In
1248, when St. Louis set out on his first crusading expedition, Joinville,
only recently become of age, took the cross and became a follower
of the king, joining him in Cyprus and there first definitely entering
his service. During the next six years the two were inseparable companions,
and even after Joinville, in 1254, retired from the king's service
in order to manage his estates in Champagne he long continued to make
frequent visits of a social character to the court.</p>

<p>Joinville's memoirs of St. Louis were completed about 1309&mdash;probably
nine years before the death of the author&mdash;and they were first
published soon after the death of Philip the Fair in 1314. They constitute
by far the most important source of information on the history of
France in the middle portion of the thirteenth century. Joinville had
the great advantage of intimate acquaintance and long association with
King Louis and, what is equally important, he seems to have tried to
write in a spirit of perfect fairness and justice. He was an ardent
admirer of Louis, but his biography did not fall into the tempting channel
of mere fulsome and indiscriminate praise. Moreover, the work is a
biography of the only really satisfactory type; it is not taken up with a
bare recital of events in the life of the individual under consideration,
but it has a broad background drawn from the general historical movements
and conditions of the time. Its most obvious defects arise from
the fact that it comprises largely the reminiscences of an old man, which
are never likely to be entirely accurate or well-balanced. In his dedication
of the treatise to Louis, eldest son of Philip IV., the author relates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
that it had been written at the urgent solicitation of the deceased king's
widow.</p>

<p>The biography in print makes a good-sized volume and it is possible,
of course, to reproduce here but a few significant passages from it.
But these are perhaps sufficient to show what sort of man the saint-king
really was, and it is just this insight into the character of the
men of the Middle Ages that is most worth getting&mdash;and the hardest
thing, as a rule, to get. Incidentally, the extract throws some light
on the methods of warfare employed by the crusaders and the Turks.</p>

<i>passim</i>.</p>

<p>As I have heard him say, he [Saint Louis] was born on the day
of St. Mark the Evangelist,<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> shortly after Easter. On that day
<span class="sidebar">The king's
birth</span>
the cross is carried in procession in many places,
and in France they are called black crosses. It
was therefore a sort of prophecy of the great numbers of people
who perished in those two crusades, i.e., in that to Egypt, and in
that other, in the course of which he died at Carthage;<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> for many
great sorrows were there on that account in this world, and many
great joys are there now in Paradise on the part of those who in
those two pilgrimages died true crusaders.</p>

<p>God, in whom he put his trust, preserved him ever from his
infancy to the very last; and especially in his infancy did He
preserve him when he stood in need of help, as you will presently
<span class="sidebar">His early
training</span>
hear. As for his soul, God preserved it through
the pious instructions of his mother, who taught
him to believe in God and to love Him, and placed about him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
none but ministers of religion. And she made him, while he was
yet a child, attend to all his prayers and listen to the sermons
on saints' days. He remembered that his mother used sometimes
to tell him that she would rather he were dead than that
he should commit a deadly sin.</p>

<p>Sore need of God's help had he in his youth, for his mother,
who came out of Spain, had neither relatives nor friends in all
the realm of France. And because the barons of France saw that
the king was an infant, and the queen, his mother, a foreigner,
they made the count of Boulogne, the king's uncle, their chief,
and looked up to him as their lord.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> After the king was crowned,
<span class="sidebar">Difficulties at
the beginning
of his reign</span>
some of the barons asked of the queen to bestow
upon them large domains; and because she would
do nothing of the kind all the barons assembled
at Corbei.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> And the sainted king related to me how neither
he nor his mother, who were at Montlhéri,<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> dared to return to
Paris, until the citizens of Paris came, with arms in their hands,
to escort them. He told me, too, that from Montlhéri to Paris
the road was filled with people, some with and some without
weapons, and that all cried unto our Lord to give him a long
and happy life, and to defend and preserve him from his
enemies....</p>

<p>After these things it chanced, as it pleased God, that great
illness fell upon the king at Paris, by which he was brought to
such extremity that one of the women who watched by his side
wanted to draw the sheet over his face, saying that he was dead;
but another woman, who was on the other side of the bed,
would not suffer it, for the soul, she said, had not yet left the
<span class="sidebar">Louis takes
the cross</span>
body. While he was listening to the dispute between
these two, our Lord wrought upon him and
quickly sent him health; for before that he was dumb, and could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
not speak. He demanded that the cross should be given to
him, and it was done. When the queen, his mother, heard that
he had recovered his speech, she exhibited as much joy as could
be; but when she was told by himself that he had taken the cross,
she displayed as much grief as if she had seen him dead.</p>

<p>After the king put on the cross, Robert, count of Artois,
Alphonse, count of Poitiers, Charles, count of Anjou, who was
afterwards king of Sicily&mdash;all three brothers of the king&mdash;also
took the cross; as likewise did Hugh, duke of Burgundy, William,
count of Flanders (brother to Count Guy of Flanders, the last
who died), the good Hugh, count of Saint Pol, and Monseigneur
<span class="sidebar">Prominent
Frenchmen
who followed
his example</span>

Walter, his nephew, who bore himself right manfully
beyond seas, and would have been of great
worth had he lived. There was also the count of
La Marche, and Monseigneur Hugh le Brun, his son; the count
of Sarrebourg, and Monseigneur d'Apremont, his brother, in
whose company I myself, John, Seigneur de Joinville, crossed
the sea in a ship we chartered, because we were cousins; and we
crossed over in all twenty knights, nine of whom followed the
count of Sarrebourg, and nine were with me....</p>

<p>The king summoned his barons to Paris, and made them
swear to keep faith and loyalty towards his children if anything
happened to himself on the voyage. He asked the same of me,
but I refused to take any oath, because I was not his vassal....</p>

<p>In the month of August we went on board our ships at the
Rock of Marseilles. The day we embarked the door of the vessel
<span class="sidebar">Embarking on
the Mediterranean</span>
was opened, and the horses that we were to take
with us were led inside. Then they fastened the
door and closed it up tightly, as when one sinks a
cask, because when the ship is at sea the whole of the door is
under water. When the horses were in, our sailing-master
called out to his mariners who were at the prow: "Are you all
ready?" And they replied: "Sir, let the clerks and priests come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
forward." As soon as they had come nigh, he shouted to them;
"Chant, in God's name!" And they with one voice chanted,
"<i>Veni, Creator Spiritus.</i>" Then the master called out to his men:
"Set sail, in God's name!" And they did so. And in a little
time the wind struck the sails and carried us out of sight of
land, so that we saw nothing but sea and sky; and every day
the wind bore us farther away from the land where we were born.
And thereby I show you how foolhardy he must be who would
venture to put himself in such peril with other people's property
in his possession, or while in deadly sin; for when you fall asleep
at night you know not but that ere the morning you may be
at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>When we reached Cyprus, the king was already there, and we
found an immense supply of stores for him, i.e., wine-stores and
granaries. The king's wine-stores consisted of great piles of casks
of wine, which his people had purchased two years before the
king's arrival and placed in an open field near the seashore.
<span class="sidebar">Preparations
made in Cyprus</span>
They had piled them one upon the other, so that
when seen from the front they looked like a
farmhouse. The wheat and barley had been
heaped up in the middle of the field, and at first sight looked like
hills; for the rain, which had long beaten upon the corn, had
caused it to sprout, so that nothing was seen but green herbage.
But when it was desired to transport it to Egypt, they broke off
the outer coating with the green herbage, and the wheat and barley
within were found as fresh as if they had only just been
threshed out.</p>

<p>The king, as I have heard him say, would gladly have pushed
on to Egypt without stopping, had not his barons advised him
to wait for his army, which had not all arrived. While the king
was sojourning in Cyprus, the great Khan of Tartary<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
envoys to him, the bearers of very courteous messages. Among
other things, he told him that he was ready to aid him in conquering
the Holy Land and in delivering Jerusalem out of the
hands of the Saracens. The king received the messengers very
graciously, and sent some to the Khan, who were two years
absent before they could return. And with his messengers the
<span class="sidebar">An embassy
from the Khan</span>
king sent to the Khan a tent fashioned like a
chapel, which cost a large sum of money, for it
was made of fine rich scarlet cloth. And the king, in the hope of
drawing the Khan's people to our faith, caused to be embroidered
inside the chapel, pictures representing the Annunciation of
Our Lady, and other articles of faith. And he sent these things
to them by the hands of two friars, who spoke the Saracen
language, to teach and point out to them what they ought to
believe....</p>

<p>As soon as March came round, the king, and, by his command,
the barons and other pilgrims, gave orders that the ships should
be laden with wine and provisions, to be ready to sail when the
king should give the signal. It happened that when everything
was ready, the king and queen withdrew on board their ship on
<span class="sidebar">The departure
from Cyprus</span>
the Friday before Whitsunday, and the king desired
his barons to follow in his wake straight
towards Egypt. On Saturday<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> the king set sail, and all
the other vessels at the same time, which was a fine sight to
behold, for it seemed as if the whole sea, as far as the eye could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
reach, was covered with sails, and the number of ships, great and
small, was reckoned at 1,800....<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the count of Poitiers, the king summoned
all the barons of the army to decide in what direction he should
march, whether towards Alexandria, or towards Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
It resulted that the good Count Peter of Brittany, and most of
the barons of the army, were of the opinion that the king should
lay siege to Alexandria, because that city is possessed of a good
<span class="sidebar">Decision
to proceed
against Cairo</span>
port where the vessels could lie that should bring
provisions for the army. To this the count of Artois
was opposed. He said that he could not advise
going anywhere except to Babylon, because that was the
chief town in all the realm of Egypt; he added, that whosoever
wished to kill a serpent outright should crush its head. The
king set aside the advice of his barons, and held to that of his
brother.</p>

<p>At the beginning of Advent, the king set out with his army to
march against Babylon, as the count of Artois had counseled
him. Not far from Damietta we came upon a stream of water
which issued from the great river [Nile], and it was resolved
that the army should halt for a day to dam up this branch, so
that it might be crossed. The thing was done easily enough,
for the arm was dammed up close to the great river. At the
passage of this stream the sultan sent 500 of his knights, the
best mounted in his whole army, to harass the king's troops,
and retard our march.</p>

<p>On St. Nicholas's day<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> the king gave the order to march
and forbade that any one should be so bold as to sally out upon
the Saracens who were before us. So it chanced that when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
army was in motion to resume the march and the Turks saw
that no one would sally out against them, and learned from their
spies that the king had forbidden it, they became emboldened
<span class="sidebar">A skirmish between
the Saracens
and the
Templars</span>
and attacked the Templars,<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> who formed the
advance-guard. And one of the Turks hurled to
the ground one of the knights of the Temple,
right before the feet of the horse of Reginald de Bichiers, who
was at that time Marshal of the Temple. When the latter saw
this, he shouted to the other brethren: "Have at them, in God's
name! I cannot suffer any more of this." He dashed in his
spurs, and all the army did likewise. Our people's horses were
fresh, while those of the Turks were already worn out. Whence
it happened, as I have heard, that not a Turk escaped, but
all perished, several of them having plunged into the river,
where they were drowned....<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>One evening when we were on duty near the cat castles, they
brought against us an engine called <i>pierrière</i>,<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> which they had
never done before, and they placed Greek fire<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> in the sling of
the engine. When Monseigneur Walter de Cureil, the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
knight, who was with me, saw that, he said to us: "Sirs, we are
in the greatest peril we have yet been in; for if they set fire to
our towers, and we remain here, we are dead men, and if we
leave our posts which have been intrusted to us, we are put to
shame; and no one can rescue us from this peril save God. It is
therefore my opinion and my advice to you that each time they
discharge the fire at us we should throw ourselves upon our
elbows and knees, and pray our Lord to bring us out of this
danger."</p>

<p>As soon as they fired we threw ourselves upon our elbows and
knees, as he had counseled us. The first shot they fired came
between our two cat castles, and fell in front of us on the open
place which the army had made for the purpose of damming the
river. Our men whose duty it was to extinguish fires were all
ready for it; and because the Saracens could not aim at them
on account of the two wings of the sheds which the king had
erected there, they fired straight up towards the clouds, so that
<span class="sidebar">The Saracens
make use of
Greek fire</span>
their darts came down from above upon the men.
The nature of the Greek fire was in this wise, that
it rushed forward as large around as a cask of
verjuice,<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> and the tail of the fire which issued from it was as big
as a large-sized spear. It made such a noise in coming that it
seemed as if it were a thunderbolt from heaven and looked like a
dragon flying through the air. It cast such a brilliant light that
in the camp they could see as clearly as if it were daytime, because
of the light diffused by such a bulk of fire. Three times
that night they discharged the Greek fire at us, and four times
they sent it from the fixed cross-bows. Each time that Our
sainted king heard that they had discharged the Greek fire at
us, he dressed himself on his bed and stretched out his hands
towards our Lord, and prayed with tears: "Fair Sire God,
preserve me my people!" And I verily believe that his prayers
stood us in good stead in our hour of need. That evening, every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
time the fire fell, he sent one of his chamberlains to inquire in
what state we were and if the fire had done us any damage.
One time when they threw it, it fell close to the cat castle which
Monseigneur de Courtenay's people were guarding, and struck
on the river-bank. Then a knight named Aubigoiz called to
me and said: "Sir, if you do not help us we are all burnt, for
the Saracens have discharged so many of their darts dipped in
Greek fire that there is of them, as it were, a great blazing
hedge coming towards our tower."</p>

<p>We ran forward and hastened thither and found that he spoke
the truth. We extinguished the fire, but before we had done
so the Saracens covered us with the darts they discharged from
the other side of the river.</p>

<p>The king's brothers mounted guard on the roof of the cat
castles to fire bolts from cross-bows against the Saracens, and
which fell into their camp. The king had commanded that when
the king of Sicily<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> mounted guard in the daytime at the cat
castles, we were to do so at night. One day when the king of
Sicily was keeping watch, which we should have to do at night, we
were in much trouble of mind because the Saracens had shattered
<span class="sidebar">Progress of
the conflict</span>
our cat castles. The Saracens brought out the
<i>pierrière</i> in the daytime, which they had hitherto
done only at night, and discharged the Greek fire at our towers.
They had advanced their engines so near to the causeway
which the army had constructed to dam the river that no one
dared to go to the towers, because of the huge stones which
the engines flung upon the road. The consequence was that
our two towers were burned, and the king of Sicily was so enraged
about it that he came near flinging himself into the fire to
extinguish it. But if he were wrathful, I and my knights, for
our part, gave thanks to God; for if we had mounted guard at
night, we should all have been burned....<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span></p>

<p>It came to pass that the sainted king labored so much that
the king of England, his wife, and children, came to France
to treat with him about peace between him and them. The
members of his council were strongly opposed to this peace, and
said to him:</p>

<p>"Sire, we greatly marvel that it should be your pleasure to yield
to the king of England such a large portion of your land, which
<span class="sidebar">The treaty
of Paris, 1259</span>
you and your predecessors have won from him, and
obtained through forfeiture. It seems to us that if
you believe you have no right to it, you do not make fitting restitution
to the king of England unless you restore to him all the conquests
which you and your predecessors have made; but if you
believe that you have a right to it, it seems to us that you are
throwing away all that you yield to him."</p>

<p>To this the sainted king replied after this fashion: "Sirs, I am
certain that the king of England's predecessors lost most justly
the conquests I hold; and the land which I give up to him I do
not give because I am bound either towards himself or his heirs,
but to create love between his children and mine, who are first
cousins. And it seems to me that I am making a good use of
what I give to him, because before he was not my vassal, but
now he has to render homage to me."...<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>After the king's return from beyond sea, he lived so devoutly
that he never afterwards wore furs of different colors, nor minnever,<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
nor scarlet cloth, nor gilt stirrups or spurs. His dress
was of camlet<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> and of a dark blue cloth; the linings of his coverlets
and garments were of doeskin or hare-legs.</p>

<p>When rich men's minstrels entered the hall after the repast,
bringing with them their viols, he waited to hear grace until the
<span class="sidebar">The king's
personal
traits</span>
minstrel had finished his chant; then he rose and
the priests who said grace stood before him. When
we were at his court in a private way,<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> he used to
sit at the foot of his bed, and when the Franciscans and Dominicans<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
who were there spoke of a book that would give him pleasure,
he would say to them: "You shall not read to me, for, after
eating, there is no book so pleasant as <i>quolibets</i>,"&mdash;that is, that
every one should say what he likes. When men of quality dined
with him, he made himself agreeable to them....</p>

<p>Many a time it happened that in the summer he would go
and sit down in the wood at Vincennes,<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> with his back to an oak,
and make us take our seats around him. And all those who had
complaints to make came to him, without hindrance from ushers
or other folk. Then he asked them with his own lips: "Is there
any one here who has a cause?"<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Those who had a cause stood
<span class="sidebar">His primitive
method of dispensing
justice</span>
up, when he would say to them: "Silence all,
and you shall be dispatched one after the other."
Then he would call Monseigneur de Fontaines, or
Monseigneur Geoffrey de Villette, and would say to one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
them: "Dispose of this case for me." When he saw anything to
amend in the words of those who spoke for others, he would correct
it with his own lips. Sometimes in summer I have seen him,
in order to administer justice to the people, come into the garden
of Paris dressed in a camlet coat, a surcoat of woollen stuff,
without sleeves, a mantle of black taffety around his neck, his
hair well combed and without coif, a hat with white peacock's
feathers on his head. Carpets were spread for us to sit down
upon around him, and all the people who had business to dispatch
stood about in front of him. Then he would have it
dispatched in the same manner as I have already described in
the wood of Vincennes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.<br />
MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITY</h3>

<h4>57. Some Twelfth Century Town Charters</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In the times of the Carolingians the small and scattered towns and
villages of western Europe, particularly of France, were inhabited
mainly by serfs and villeins, i.e., by a dependent rather than an independent
population. With scarcely an exception, these urban centers
belonged to the lords of the neighboring lands, who administered their
affairs through mayors, provosts, bailiffs, or other agents, collected from
them seigniorial dues as from the rural peasantry, and, in short, took
entire charge of matters of justice, finance, military obligations, and
industrial arrangements. There was no local self-government, nothing
in the way of municipal organization separate from the feudal régime,
and no important burgher class as distinguished from the agricultural
laborers. By the twelfth century a great transformation is apparent.
France has come to be dotted with strong and often largely independent
municipalities, and a powerful class of bourgeoisie, essentially anti-feudal
in character, has risen to play an increasing part in the nation's
political and economic life. In these new municipalities there is a larger
measure of freedom of person, security of property, and rights of self-government
than Europe had known since the days of Charlemagne,
perhaps even since the best period of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>The reason for this transformation&mdash;in other words, the origin of these
new municipal centers&mdash;has been variously explained. One theory is
that the municipal system of the Middle Ages was essentially a survival
of that which prevailed in western Europe under the fostering influence
of Rome. The best authorities now reject this view, for there is every
reason to believe that, speaking generally, the barbarian invasions and
feudalism practically crushed out the municipal institutions of the Empire.
Another theory ascribes the origin of mediæval municipal government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
to the merchant and craft guilds, particularly the former; but
there is little evidence to support the view. Undeniably the guild was
an important factor in drawing groups of burghers together and forming
centers of combination against local lords, but it was at best only one
of several forces tending to the growth of municipal life. Other factors
of larger importance were the military and the commercial. On the one
hand, the need of protection led people to flock to fortified places&mdash;castles
or monasteries&mdash;and settle in the neighborhood; on the other,
the growth of commerce and industry, especially after the eleventh
century, caused strategic places like the intersection of great highways
and rivers to become seats of permanent and growing population. The
towns which thus sprang up in response to new conditions and necessities
in time took on a political as well as a commercial and industrial character,
principally through the obtaining of charters from the neighboring
lords, defining the measure of independence to be enjoyed and the respective
rights of lord and town. Charters of the sort were usually
granted by the lord, not merely because requested by the burghers,
but because they were paid for and constituted a valuable source of
revenue. Not infrequently, however, a charter was wrested from an
unwilling lord through open warfare. It was in the first half of the
twelfth century that town charters became common. As a rule they
were obtained by the larger towns (it should be borne in mind that a
population of 10,000 was large in the twelfth century), but not necessarily
so, for many villages of two or three hundred people secured them
also.</p>

<p>The two great classes of towns were the <i>villes libres</i> (free towns)
and the <i>villes franches</i>, or <i>villes de bourgeoisie</i> (franchise, or chartered,
towns). The free towns enjoyed a large measure of independence.
In relation to their lords they occupied essentially the position of vassals,
with the legislative, financial, and judicial privileges which by the
twelfth century all great vassals had come to have. The burghers
elected their own officers, constituted their own courts, made their own
laws, levied taxes, and even waged war. The leading types of free cities
were the communes of northern France (governed by a provost and one
or more councils, often essentially oligarchical) and the consulates of
southern France and northern Italy (distinguished from the communes
by the fact that the executive was made up of "consuls," and by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
greater participation of the local nobility in town affairs). A typical
free town of the commune type, was Laon, in the region of northern
Champagne. In 1109 the bishop of Laon, who was lord of the city,
consented to the establishment of a communal government. Three
years later he sought to abolish it, with the result that an insurrection
was stirred up in which he lost his life. King Louis VI. intervened and
the citizens were obliged to submit to the authority of the new bishop,
though in 1328 fear of another uprising led this official to renew the old
grant. The act was ratified by Louis VI. in the text (a) given below.</p>

<p>The other great class of towns&mdash;the franchise towns&mdash;differed from
the free towns in having a much more limited measure of political and
economic independence. They received grants of privileges, or "franchises,"
from their lord, especially in the way of restrictions of rights of
the latter over the persons and property of the inhabitants, but they
remained politically subject to the lord and their government was partly
or wholly under his control. Their charters set a limit to the lord's
arbitrary authority, emancipated such inhabitants as were not already
free, gave the citizens the right to move about and to alienate property,
substituted money payments for the corvée, and in general made old
regulations less burdensome; but as a rule no political rights were conferred.
Paris, Tours, Orleans, and other more important cities on the
royal domain belonged to this class. The town of Lorris, on the royal
domain a short distance east of Orleans, became the common model for
the type. Its charter, received from Louis VII. in 1155, is given in
the second selection (b) below.</p>

<h4>58. The Colonization of Eastern Germany</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In the time of Charlemagne the Elbe River marked a pretty clear
boundary between the Slavic population to the east and the Germanic
to the west. There were many Slavs west of the Elbe, but no Germans
east of it. There had been a time when Germans occupied large portions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
of eastern Europe, but for one reason or another they gradually became
concentrated toward the west, while Slavic peoples pushed in to fill the
vacated territory. Under Charlemagne and his successors we can discern
the earlier stages of a movement of reaction which has gone on in
later times until the political map of all north central Europe has been
remodeled. During the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries large portions
of the "sphere of influence" (to use a modern phrase) which
Charlemagne had created eastward from the Elbe were converted into
German principalities and dependencies. German colonists pushed
down the Danube, well toward the Black Sea, along the Baltic, past the
Oder and toward the Vistula, and up the Oder into the heart of modern
Poland. The Slavic population was slowly brought under subjection,
Christianized, and to a certain extent Germanized. In the tenth century
Henry I. (919-936) began a fresh forward movement against the Slavs,
or Wends, as the Germans called them. Magdeburg, on the Elbe, was
established as the chief base of operations. The work was kept up by
Henry's son, Otto I. (936-973), but under his grandson, Otto II. (973-983),
a large part of what had been gained was lost for a time through a
Slavic revolt called out by the Emperor's preoccupation with affairs in
Italy. Thereafter for a century the Slavs were allowed perforce to enjoy
their earlier independence, and upon more than one occasion they
were able to assume the aggressive against their would-be conquerors.
In 1066 the city of Hamburg, on the lower Elbe, was attacked and
almost totally destroyed. The imperial power was fast declining and the
Franconian sovereigns had little time left from their domestic conflicts
and quarrels with the papacy to carry on a contest on the east.</p>

<p>The renewed advance which the Germans made against the Slavs in
the later eleventh and earlier twelfth centuries was due primarily to the
energy of the able princes of Saxony and to the pressure for colonization,
which increased in spite of small encouragement from any
except the local authorities. The document given below is a typical
charter of the period, authorizing the establishment of a colony of Germans
eastward from Hamburg, on the border of Brandenburg. It was
granted in 1106 by the bishop of Hamburg, who as lord of the region
in which the proposed settlement was to be made exercised the right
not merely of giving consent to the undertaking, but also of prescribing
the terms and conditions by which the colonists were to be bound.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
As appears from the charter, the colony was expected to be a source
of profit to the bishop; and indeed it was financial considerations on the
part of lords, lay and spiritual, who had stretches of unoccupied land at
their disposal, almost as much as regard for safety in numbers and the
absolute dominance of Germanic peoples, that prompted these local
magnates of eastern Germany so ardently to promote the work of
colonization.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity. Frederick,

Christ, gives a perpetual benediction. We wish to make known
to all the agreement which certain people living this side of the
Rhine, who are called Hollanders,<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> have made with us.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> These men came to us and earnestly begged us to grant
them certain lands in our bishopric, which are uncultivated,
<span class="sidebar">The Hollanders
ask land
for a colony</span>
swampy, and useless to our people. We have
consulted our subjects about this and, feeling
that this would be profitable to us and to our
successors, have granted their request.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> The agreement was made that they should pay us every
year one <i>denarius</i> for every hide of land. We have thought it
necessary to determine the dimensions of the hide, in order that
no quarrel may thereafter arise about it. The hide shall be
720 royal rods long and thirty royal rods wide. We also grant
them the streams which flow through this land.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> They agreed to give the tithe according to our decree, that
is, every eleventh sheaf of grain, every tenth lamb, every tenth
pig, every tenth goat, every tenth goose, and a tenth of the

honey and of the flax. For every colt they shall pay a <i>denarius</i>
on St. Martin's day [Nov. 11], and for every calf an obol [penny].</p>

they may wish on these lands. For the support of the

<h4>59. The League of Rhenish Cities (1254)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>About the middle of the thirteenth century the central authority of
the Holy Roman Empire was for a time practically dissolved. Frederick
II., the last strong ruler of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, died in 1250, and
even he was so largely Italian in character and interests that he could
bring himself to give little attention to German affairs. During the
stormy period of the Interregnum (1254-1273) there was no universally
recognized emperor at all. Germany had reached an advanced stage of
political disintegration and it is scarcely conceivable that even a Henry
IV. or a Frederick Barbarossa could have made the imperial power much
more than a shadow and a name. But while the Empire was broken up
into scores of principalities, independent cities, and other political fragments,
its people were enjoying a vigorous and progressive life. The
period was one of great growth of industry in the towns, and especially
of commerce. The one serious disadvantage was the lack of a central
police authority to preserve order and insure the safety of person and
property. Warfare was all but ceaseless, robber-bands infested the
rivers and highways, and all manner of vexatious conditions were imposed
upon trade by the various local authorities. The natural result
was the formation of numerous leagues and confederacies for the suppression
of anarchy and the protection of trade and industry. The
greatest of these was the Hanseatic League, which came to comprise
one hundred and seventy-two cities, and the history of whose operations
runs through more than three centuries. An earlier organization, which
may be considered in a way a forerunner of the Hansa, was the Rhine
League, established in 1254. At this earlier date Conrad IV., son of
Frederick II., was fighting his half-brother Manfred for their common
Sicilian heritage; William of Holland, who claimed the imperial title,
was recognized in only a small territory and was quite powerless to affect
conditions of disorder outside; the other princes, great and small, were
generally engaged in private warfare; and the difficulties and dangers of
trade and industry were at their maximum. To establish a power
strong enough, and with the requisite disposition, to suppress the robbers
and pirates who were ruining commerce, the leading cities of the
Rhine valley&mdash;Mainz, Cologne, Worms, Speyer, Strassburg, Basel,
Trier, Metz, and others&mdash;entered into a "league of holy peace," to endure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
for a period of ten years, dating from July 13, 1254. The more significant
terms of the compact are set forth in the selection below.</p>

<p>In the name of the Lord, amen. In the year of our Lord 1254,
on the octave of St. Michael's day [a week after Sept. 29] we,
the cities of the upper and lower Rhine, leagued together for the
preservation of peace, met in the city of Worms. We held a
conference there and carefully discussed everything pertaining to
<span class="sidebar">The league
formed at
Worms</span>
a general peace. To the honor of God, and of the
holy mother Church, and of the holy Empire,
which is now governed by our lord, William,
king of the Romans,<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> and to the common advantage of all, both
rich and poor alike, we made the following laws. They are for
the benefit of all, both poor and great, the secular clergy, monks,
laymen, and Jews. To secure these things, which are for the
public good, we will spare neither ourselves nor our possessions.
The princes and lords who take the oath are joined with us.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> We decree that we will make no warlike expeditions, except
those that are absolutely necessary and determined on by the
wise counsel of the cities and communes. We will mutually
aid each other with all our strength in securing redress for our
grievances.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> We decree that no member of the league, whether city
<span class="sidebar">No dealings
to be had with
enemies of the
league</span>
or lord, Christian or Jew, shall furnish food,
arms, or aid of any kind, to any one who opposes
us or the peace.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> And no one in our cities shall give credit, or make a loan,
to them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p><b>4.</b> No citizen of any of the cities in the league shall associate
with such, or give them counsel, aid, or support. If any one is
convicted of doing so, he shall be expelled from the city and
punished so severely in his property that he will be a warning
to others not to do such things.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> If any knight, in trying to aid his lord who is at war with
us, attacks or molests us anywhere outside of the walled towns
of his lord, he is breaking the peace, and we will in some way
<span class="sidebar">A warning
to enemies</span>
inflict due punishment on him and his possessions,
no matter who he is. If he is caught in any of
the cities, he shall be held as a prisoner until he makes proper
satisfaction. We wish to be protectors of the peasants, and we
will protect them against all violence if they will observe the
peace with us. But if they make war on us, we will punish them,
and if we catch them in any of the cities, we will punish them
as malefactors.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> We wish the cities to destroy all the ferries except those
in their immediate neighborhood, so that there shall be no
ferries except those near the cities which are in the league.
This is to be done in order that the enemies of the peace may be
deprived of all means of crossing the Rhine.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> We decree that if any lord or knight aids us in promoting
the peace, we will do all we can to protect him. Whoever does
not swear to keep the peace with us, shall be excluded from the
general peace.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Above all, we wish to affirm that we desire to live in
mutual peace with the lords and all the people of the province,
and we desire that each should preserve all his rights.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Under threat of punishment we forbid any citizen to revile
the lords, although they may be our enemies. For although we
wish to punish them for the violence they have done us, yet before
making war on them we will first warn them to cease from
injuring us.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> We decree that all correspondence about this matter with

<p><b>13.</b> We also promise, both lords and cities, to send four
official representatives to whatever place a conference is to be

their cities to decide on all matters. They shall

All who come with the representatives of the cities, or who
come to them while in session, shall have peace, and no judgment
shall be enforced against them.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> We firmly declare that if any member of the league
breaks the peace, we will proceed against him at once as if he

<p><b>16.</b> We promise that we will faithfully keep each other informed

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
UNIVERSITIES AND STUDENT LIFE</h3>

<p>The modern university is essentially a product of the Middle Ages.
The Greeks and Romans had provisions for higher education, but nothing
that can properly be termed universities, with faculties, courses of
study, examinations, and degrees. The word "universitas" in the
earlier mediæval period was applied indiscriminately to any group or
body of people, as a guild of artisans or an organization of the clergy,
and only very gradually did it come to be restricted to an association
of teachers and students&mdash;the so-called <i>universitas societas magistrorum
discipulorumque</i>. The origins of mediæval universities are, in most
cases, rather obscure. In the earlier Middle Ages the interests of
learning were generally in the keeping of the monks and the work of
education was carried on chiefly in monastic schools, where the subjects
of study were commonly the seven liberal arts inherited from Roman
days.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> By the twelfth century there was a relative decline of these
monastic schools, accompanied by a marked development of cathedral
schools in which not only the seven liberal arts but also new subjects
like law and theology were taught. The twelfth century renaissance
brought a notable revival of Roman law, medicine, astronomy, and
philosophy; by 1200 the whole of Aristotle's writings had become known;
and the general awakening produced immediate results in the larger
numbers of students who flocked to places like Paris and Bologna where
exceptional teachers were to be found.</p>

<p>Out of these conditions grew the earliest of the universities. No
definite dates for the beginnings of Paris, Bologna, Oxford, etc., can
be assigned, but the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are to be considered
their great formative period. Bologna was specifically the creation of
the revived study of the Roman law and of the fame of the great law
teacher Irnerius. The university sprang from a series of organizations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
effected first by the students and later by the masters, or teachers, and
modeled after the guilds of workmen. It became the pattern for most of
the later Italian and Spanish universities. Paris arose in a different
way. It grew directly out of the great cathedral school of Notre Dame
and, unlike Bologna, was an organization at the outset of masters rather
than of students. It was presided over by the chancellor, who had had
charge of education in the cathedral and who retained the exclusive
privilege of granting licenses to teach (the <i>licentia docendi</i>), or, in other
words, degrees.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> Rising to prominence in the twelfth century, especially
by virtue of the teaching of Abelard (1079-1142), Paris became in time
the greatest university of the Middle Ages, exerting profound influence
not only on learning, but also on the Church and even at times on political
affairs. The universities of the rest of France, as well as the German
universities and Oxford and Cambridge in England, were copied pretty
closely after Paris.</p>

<h4>60. Privileges Granted to Students and Masters</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Throughout the Middle Ages numerous special favors were showered
upon the universities and their students by the Church. Patronage and
protection from the secular authorities were less to be depended on,
though the courts of kings were not infrequently the rendezvous of
scholars, and the greater seats of learning after the eleventh century
generally owed their prosperity, if not their origin, to the liberality of
monarchs such as Frederick Barbarossa or Philip Augustus. The
recognition of the universities by the temporal powers came as a rule
earlier than that by the Church. The edict of the Emperor Frederick I.,
which comprises selection (a) below, was issued in 1158 and is not to
be considered as limited in its application to the students of any particular
university, though many writers have associated it solely with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
the University of Bologna. That the statute was decreed at the solicitation
of the Bologna doctors of law admits of little doubt, but, as
Rashdall observes, it was "a general privilege conferred on the student
class throughout the Lombard kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> By some writers it is said
to have been the earliest formal grant of privileges for university students,
but this cannot be true as Salerno (notable chiefly for medical
studies) received such grants from Robert Guiscard and his son Roger
before the close of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>Until the year 1200 the students of Paris enjoyed no privileges such
as those conferred upon the Italian institutions by Frederick. In that
year a tavern brawl occurred between some German students and
Parisian townspeople, in which five of the students lost their lives.
The provost of the city, instead of attempting to repress the disorder,
took sides against the students and encouraged the populace. Such
laxity stirred the king, Philip Augustus, to action. Fearing that the
students would decamp <i>en masse</i>, he hastened to comply with their
appeal for redress. The provost and his lieutenants were arrested
and a decree was issued [given, in part, in selection (b)] exempting
the scholars from the operation of the municipal law in criminal cases.
Pope Innocent III. at once confirmed the privileges and on his part
relaxed somewhat the vigilance of the Church. Such liberal measures,
however, did not insure permanent peace. In less than three decades
another conflict with the provost occurred which was so serious as to
result in a total suspension of the university's activities for more than
two years.</p>

<p class="center">(a)</p>

<p>After a careful consideration of this subject by the bishops,
abbots, dukes, counts, judges, and other nobles of our sacred
palace, we, from our piety, have granted this privilege to all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
scholars who travel for the sake of study, and especially to the
professors of divine and sacred laws,<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> namely, that they may
<span class="sidebar">Security
of travel and
residence for
scholars</span>
go in safety to the places in which the studies
are carried on, both they themselves and their
messengers, and may dwell there in security.
For we think it fitting that, during good behavior, those should
enjoy our praise and protection, by whose learning the world
is enlightened to the obedience of God and of us, his ministers,
and the life of the subject is molded; and by a special consideration
we defend them from all injuries.</p>

<p>For who does not pity those who exile themselves through
love for learning, who wear themselves out in poverty in place
of riches, who expose their lives to all perils and often suffer
bodily injury from the vilest men? This must be endured with
vexation. Therefore, we declare by this general and perpetual
law, that in the future no one shall be so rash as to venture to
<span class="sidebar">Regulation
concerning
the collection
of debts</span>
inflict any injury on scholars, or to occasion any
loss to them on account of a debt owed by an
inhabitant of their province&mdash;a thing which we
have learned is sometimes done by an evil custom.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> And let it
be known to the violators of this constitution, and also to those
who shall at the time be the rulers of the places, that a fourfold
restitution of property shall be exacted from all and that, the
mark of infamy being affixed to them by the law itself, they
shall lose their office forever.</p>

<p>Moreover, if any one shall presume to bring a suit against them
on account of any business, the choice in this matter shall be
<span class="sidebar">Judicial
privileges of
scholars</span>
given to the scholars, who may summon the
accusers to appear before their professors or the
bishop of the city, to whom we have given jurisdiction
in this matter.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> But if, indeed, the accuser shall attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
to drag the scholar before another judge, even if his cause is a
very just one, he shall lose his suit for such an attempt.</p>

<p class="center">(b)</p>

<p>Concerning the safety of the students at Paris in the future,
by the advice of our subjects we have ordained as follows:</p>

<p>We will cause all the citizens of Paris to swear that if any one
sees an injury done to any student by any layman,<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> he will
testify truthfully to this, nor will any one withdraw in order not
to see [the act]. And if it shall happen that any one strikes a
student, except in self-defense, especially if he strikes the student
with a weapon, a club, or a stone, all laymen who see [the act]
<span class="sidebar">Protection
for scholars
against crimes
of violence</span>
shall in good faith seize the malefactor, or malefactors,
and deliver them to our judge; nor shall
they run away in order not to see the act, or
seize the malefactor, or testify to the truth. Also, whether the
malefactor is seized in open crime or not, we will make a legal
and full examination through clerks, or laymen, or certain lawful
persons; and our count and our judges shall do the same. And
if by a full examination we, or our judges, are able to learn that
he who is accused, is guilty of the crime, then we, or our judges,
shall immediately inflict a penalty, according to the quality and
nature of the crime; notwithstanding the fact that the criminal
may deny the deed and say that he is ready to defend himself
in single combat, or to purge himself by the ordeal by water.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Also, neither our provost nor our judges shall lay hands on a
student for any offense whatever; nor shall they place him in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
our prison, unless such a crime has been committed by the
student, that he ought to be arrested. And in that case, our
judge shall arrest him on the spot, without striking him at all,
unless he resists, and shall hand him over to the ecclesiastical
judge,<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> who ought to guard him in order to satisfy us and the
one suffering the injury. And if a serious crime has been committed,
our judge shall go or shall send to see what is done with
the student. If, indeed, the student does not resist arrest and
yet suffers any injury, we will exact satisfaction for it, according
<span class="sidebar">Scholars to be
tried and punished
under
ecclesiastical
authority</span>
to the aforesaid examination and the aforesaid
oath. Also our judges shall not lay hands
on the chattels of the students of Paris for any
crime whatever. But if it shall seem that these
ought to be sequestrated, they shall be sequestrated and guarded
after sequestration by the ecclesiastical judge, in order that
whatever is judged legal by the Church may be done with the
chattels.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> But if students are arrested by our count at such
an hour that the ecclesiastical judge cannot be found and be
present at once, our provost shall cause the culprits to be guarded
in some student's house without any ill-treatment, as is said
above, until they are delivered to the ecclesiastical judge.</p>

<p>In order, moreover, that these [decrees] may be kept more
carefully and may be established forever by a fixed law, we have
decided that our present provost and the people of Paris shall
<span class="sidebar">The oath required
of the
provost and
people of Paris</span>
affirm by an oath, in the presence of the scholars,
that they will carry out in good faith all the
above-mentioned [regulations]. And always in
the future, whosoever receives from us the office of provost in
Paris, among the inaugural acts of his office, namely, on the first
or second Sunday, in one of the churches of Paris&mdash;after he has
been summoned for the purpose&mdash;shall affirm by an oath, publicly
in the presence of the scholars, that he will keep in good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
faith all the above-mentioned [regulations].<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> And that these
decrees may be valid forever, we have ordered this document
to be confirmed by the authority of our seal and by the characters
of the royal name signed below.</p>

<h4>61. The Foundation of the University of Heidelberg (1386)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Until the middle of the fourteenth century Germany possessed no
university. In the earlier mediæval period, when palace and monastic
schools were multiplying in France, Italy, and England, German culture
was too backward to permit of a similar movement beyond the
Rhine; and later, when in other countries universities were springing
into prosperity, political dissensions long continued to thwart such
enterprises among the Germans. Germany was not untouched by the
intellectual movements of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but her
young men were obliged to seek their learning at Oxford or Paris or
Bologna. The first German university was that of Prague, in Bohemia,
founded by Emperor Charles IV., a contemporary of Petrarch, and
chartered in 1348. Once begun, the work of establishing such institutions
went on rapidly, until ere long every principality of note had its
own university. Vienna was founded in 1365, Erfurt was given papal
sanction in 1379, Heidelberg was established in 1386, and Cologne
followed in 1388. The document given below is the charter of privileges
issued for Heidelberg in October, 1386, by the founder, Rupert I., Count
Palatine of the Rhine. Marsilius Inghen became the first rector of the
university. He and two other masters began lecturing October 19,
1386&mdash;one on logic, another on the epistle to Titus, the third on the
philosophy of Aristotle. Within four years over a thousand students
had been in attendance at the university.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> We, Rupert the elder, by the grace of God count palatine

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
we seem to abuse the privilege conceded to us by the
apostolic see of founding a place of study at Heidelberg similar
to that at Paris, and lest, for this reason, being subjected to the
divine judgment, we should deserve to be deprived of the privilege
granted&mdash;do decree, with provident counsel (which decree
is to be observed unto all time), that the University of Heidelberg
shall be ruled, disposed, and regulated according to the
modes and manners accustomed to be observed in the University
<span class="sidebar">The university
to be organized
on the
model of Paris</span>
of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Also that, as a handmaid of Paris&mdash;a
worthy one let us hope&mdash;the latter's steps shall
be imitated in every way possible; so that,
namely, there shall be four faculties in it: the first, of sacred
theology and divinity; the second, of canon and civil law, which,
by reason of their similarity, we think best to comprise under
one faculty; the third, of medicine; the fourth, of liberal arts&mdash;of
the three-fold philosophy, namely, primal, natural, and moral,
three mutually subservient daughters.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> We wish this institution
to be divided and marked out into four nations, as it is at
Paris;<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> and that all these faculties shall make one university,
and that to it the individual students, in whatever of the said
faculties they are, shall unitedly belong like lawful sons to one
mother.</p>

<p>Likewise [we desire] that this university shall be governed by
one rector,<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> and that the various masters and teachers, before
they are admitted to the common pursuits of our institution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
shall swear to observe the statutes, laws, privileges, liberties, and
franchises of the same, and not reveal its secrets, to whatever
grade they may rise. Also that they will uphold the honor of
the rector and the rectorship of our university, and will obey
<span class="sidebar">The obligations
of the masters</span>
the rector in all things lawful and honest, whatever
be the grade to which they may afterwards
happen to be promoted. Moreover, that the various masters
and bachelors shall read their lectures and exercise their scholastic
functions and go about in caps and gowns of a uniform and
similar nature, according as has been observed at Paris up to
this time in the different faculties.</p>

<p>And we will that if any faculty, nation, or person shall oppose
the aforesaid regulations, or stubbornly refuse to obey them,
or any one of them&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;from that time forward
that same faculty, nation, or person, if it do not desist upon
being warned, shall be deprived of all connection with our aforesaid
institution, and shall not have the benefit of our defense or
<span class="sidebar">Internal government
of the
university further
provided
for</span>
protection. Moreover, we will and ordain that
as the university as a whole may do for those
assembled here and subject to it, so each faculty,
nation, or province of it may enact lawful statutes,
such as are suitable to its needs, provided that through them,
or any one of them, no prejudice is done to the above regulations
and to our institution, and that no kind of impediment arise
from them. And we will that when the separate bodies shall
have passed the statutes for their own observance, they may
make them perpetually binding on those subject to them and
on their successors. And as in the University of Paris the
various servants of the institution have the benefit of the various
privileges which its masters and scholars enjoy, so in starting
our institution in Heidelberg, we grant, with even greater
liberality, through these presents, that all the servants, i.e., its
pedells,<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> librarians, lower officials, preparers of parchment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
scribes, illuminators and others who serve it, may each and all,
without fraud, enjoy in it the same privileges, franchises, immunities
and liberties with which its masters or scholars are
now or shall hereafter be endowed.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Lest in the new community of the city of Heidelberg, their
misdeeds being unpunished, there be an incentive to the scholars
of doing wrong, we ordain, with provident counsel, by these presents,
that the bishop of Worms, as judge ordinary of the clerks
of our institution, shall have and possess, now and hereafter
while our institution shall last, prisons, and an office in our
town of Heidelberg for the detention of criminal clerks. These
<span class="sidebar">The jurisdiction
of the
bishop of
Worms</span>
things we have seen fit to grant to him and his
successors, adding these conditions: that he shall
permit no clerk to be arrested unless for a misdemeanor;
that he shall restore any one detained for such fault, or
for any light offense, to his master, or to the rector if the latter asks
for him, a promise having been given that the culprit will appear
in court and that the rector or master will answer for him if the
injured parties should go to law about the matter. Furthermore,
that, on being requested, he will restore a clerk arrested for a
crime on slight evidence, upon receiving a sufficient pledge&mdash;sponsors
if the prisoner can obtain them, otherwise an oath if
he cannot obtain sponsors&mdash;to the effect that he will answer in
court the charges against him; and in all these things there shall
be no pecuniary exactions, except that the clerk shall give satisfaction,
<span class="sidebar">Conditions of
imprisonment</span>
reasonably and according to the rule of
the aforementioned town, for the expenses which
he incurred while in prison. And we desire that he will detain
honestly and without serious injury a criminal clerk thus arrested
for a crime where the suspicion is grave and strong, until
the truth can be found out concerning the deed of which he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
suspected. And he shall not for any cause, moreover, take away
any clerk from our aforesaid town, or permit him to be taken
away, unless the proper observances have been followed, and
he has been condemned by judicial sentence to perpetual imprisonment
for a crime.</p>

<p>We command our advocate and bailiff and their servants in
our aforesaid town, under pain of losing their offices and our
favor, not to lay a detaining hand on any master or scholar of
our said institution, nor to arrest him or allow him to be
<span class="sidebar">Limitations
upon power to
arrest students</span>
arrested, unless the deed be such that that
master or scholar ought rightly to be detained.
He shall be restored to his rector or master, if he
is held for a slight cause, provided he will swear and promise to
appear in court concerning the matter; and we decree that a
slight fault is one for which a layman, if he had committed it,
ought to have been condemned to a light pecuniary fine. Likewise,
if the master or scholar detained be found gravely or
strongly suspected of the crime, we command that he be handed
over by our officials to the bishop or to his representative in our
said town, to be kept in custody.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> By the tenor of these presents we grant to each and all
the masters and scholars that, when they come to the said institution,
while they remain there, and also when they return
from it to their homes, they may freely carry with them, both
coming and going, throughout all the lands subject to us, all
things which they need while pursuing their studies, and all the
<span class="sidebar">Students exempted
from
various imposts</span>
goods necessary for their support, without any
duty, levy, imposts, tolls, excises, or other exactions
whatever. And we wish them and each
one of them, to be free from the aforesaid imposts when purchasing
corn, wines, meat, fish, clothes and all things necessary for
their living and for their rank. And we decree that the scholars
from their stock in hand of provisions, if there remain over one
or two wagonloads of wine without their having practised deception,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
may, after the feast of Easter of that year, sell it at
wholesale without paying impost. We grant to them, moreover,
that each day the scholars, of themselves or through their servants,
may be allowed to buy in the town of Heidelberg, at the
accustomed hour, freely and without impediment or hurtful
delay, any eatables or other necessaries of life.</p>

<p>4. Lest the masters and scholars of our institution of Heidelberg
may be oppressed by the citizens, moved by avarice,
through extortionate prices of lodgings, we have seen fit to
decree that henceforth each year, after Christmas, one expert
from the university on the part of the scholars, and one prudent,
<span class="sidebar">How rates for
lodging should

<h4>62. Mediæval Students' Songs</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>"When we try to picture to ourselves," says Mr. Symonds in one of
his felicitous passages, "the intellectual and moral state of Europe in
the Middle Ages, some fixed and almost stereotyped ideas immediately
suggest themselves. We think of the nations immersed in a gross mental
lethargy; passively witnessing the gradual extinction of arts and sciences
which Greece and Rome had splendidly inaugurated; allowing libraries
and monuments of antique civilization to crumble into dust; while they
trembled under a dull and brooding terror of coming judgment, shrank
from natural enjoyment as from deadly sin, or yielded themselves with
brutal eagerness to the satisfaction of vulgar appetites. Preoccupation
with the other world in this long period weakens man's hold upon the
things that make his life desirable.... Prolonged habits of extra-mundane
contemplation, combined with the decay of real knowledge,
volatilize the thoughts and aspirations of the best and wisest into dreamy
unrealities, giving a false air of mysticism to love, shrouding art in allegory,
reducing the interpretation of texts to an exercise of idle ingenuity,
and the study of nature to an insane system of grotesque and pious
quibbling. The conception of man's fall and of the incurable badness of
this world bears poisonous fruit of cynicism and asceticism, that two-fold
bitter almond hidden in the harsh monastic shell. Nature is regarded
with suspicion and aversion; the flesh, with shame and loathing,
broken by spasmodic outbursts of lawless self-indulgence."<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>All of these ideas are properly to be associated with the Middle Ages,
but it must be borne in mind that they represent only one side of the
picture. They are drawn very largely from the study of monastic
literature and produce a somewhat distorted impression. Though many
conditions prevailing in mediæval times operated strongly to paralyze
the intellects and consciences of men, the fundamental manifestations
and expressions of human instinct and vitality were far from crushed
out. The life of many people was full and varied and positive&mdash;not
so different, after all, from that of men and women to-day. That this
was true is demonstrated by a wealth of literature reflecting the jovial
and exuberant aspects of mediæval life, which has come down to us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
chiefly in two great groups&mdash;the poetry of the troubadours and the songs
of the wandering students. "That so bold, so fresh, so natural, so pagan
a view of life," continues Mr. Symonds in the passage quoted, "as the
Latin songs of the Wandering Students exhibit, should have found clear
and artistic utterance in the epoch of the Crusades, is indeed enough to
bid us pause and reconsider the justice of our stereotyped ideas about
that period. This literature makes it manifest that the ineradicable
appetites and natural instincts of men and women were no less vigorous
in fact, though less articulate and self-assertive, than they had been in
the age of Greece and Rome, and than they afterwards displayed themselves
in what is known as the Renaissance. The songs of the Wandering
Students were composed for the most part in the twelfth century.
Uttering the unrestrained emotions of men attached by a slender tie
to the dominant clerical class and diffused over all countries, they
bring us face to face with a body of opinion which finds in studied
chronicle or labored dissertation of the period no echo. On the one side,
they express that delight in life and physical enjoyment which was a
main characteristic of the Renaissance; on the other, they proclaim that
revolt against the corruption of Papal Rome which was the motive force
of the Reformation. Who were these Wandering Students? As their
name implies, they were men, and for the most part young men, traveling
from university to university in search of knowledge. Far from
their homes, without responsibilities, light of purse and light of heart,
careless and pleasure-seeking, they ran a free, disreputable course,
frequenting taverns at least as much as lecture-rooms, more capable of
pronouncing judgment upon wine or woman than upon a problem of
divinity or logic. These pilgrims to the shrines of knowledge formed a
class apart. According to tendencies prevalent in the Middle Ages,
they became a sort of guild, and with pride proclaimed themselves an
Order."<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>Our knowledge of the mediæval students' songs is derived from two
principal sources: (1) a richly illuminated thirteenth-century manuscript
now preserved at Munich and edited in 1847 under the title <i>Carmina
Burana</i>; and (2) another thirteenth-century manuscript published (with
other materials) in 1841 under the title <i>Latin Poems commonly attributed
to Walter Mapes</i>. Many songs occur in both collections. The half-dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
given in translation below very well illustrate the subjects, tone,
and style of these interesting bits of literature.</p>

The following jovial <i>Song of the Open Road</i> throbs with exhilaration
and even impudence. Two vagabond students are drinking together
before they part. One of them undertakes to expound the laws of the
brotherhood which bind them together. The refrain is intended apparently
to imitate a bugle call.</p>

<p>Next to love and the springtime, the average student set his affections
principally on the tavern and the wine-bowl. From his proneness to
frequent the tavern's jovial company of topers and gamesters naturally
sprang a liberal supply of drinking songs. Here is a fragment from one
of them.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Some are gaming, some are drinking,</p>
<p>Some are living without thinking;</p>
<p>And of those who make the racket,</p>
<p>Some are stripped of coat and jacket;</p>
<p>Some get clothes of finer feather,</p>
<p>Some are cleaned out altogether;</p>
<p>No one there dreads death's invasion,</p>
<p>But all drink in emulation.</p>
</div>

<p>Finally may be given, in the original Latin, a stanza of a drinking
song which fell to such depths of irreverence as to comprise a parody of
Thomas Aquinas's hymn on the Lord's Supper.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
THE FRIARS</h3>

<p>From the twelfth century onwards one of the most conspicuous
features of the internal development of the mediæval Church was the
struggle to combat worldliness among ecclesiastics and to preserve the
purity of doctrine and uprightness of living which had characterized
the primitive Christian clergy. As the Middle Ages advanced to their
close, unimpeachable evidence accumulates that the Church was increasingly
menaced by grave abuses. This evidence appears not only
in contemporary records and chronicles but even more strikingly in the
great protesting movements which spring up in rapid succession&mdash;particularly
the rise of heretical sects, such as the Waldenses and the Albigenses,
and the inauguration of systematic efforts to regenerate the church
body without disrupting its unity. These latter efforts at first took the
form of repeated revivals of monastic enthusiasm and self-denial,
marked by the founding of a series of new orders on the basis of the
Benedictine Rule&mdash;the Cluniacs, the Carthusians, the Cistercians, and
others of their kind [see <a href="#Page_245">p. 245</a>]. This resource proving ineffective, the
movement eventually came to comprise the establishment of wholly
new and independent organizations&mdash;the mendicant orders&mdash;on principles
better adapted than were those of monasticism to the successful
propagation of simplicity and purity of Christian living. The chief of
these new orders were the Franciscans, known also as Gray Friars and
as Minorites, and the Dominicans, sometimes called Black Friars or
Preaching Friars. Both were founded in the first quarter of the thirteenth
century, the one by St. Francis of Assisi; the other by the Spanish
nobleman, St. Dominic.</p>

<p>The friars, of whatsoever type, are clearly to be distinguished from the
monks. In the first place, their aims were different. The monks, in so
far as they were true to their principles, lived in more or less seclusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
from the rest of the world and gave themselves up largely to prayer and
meditation; the fundamental purpose of the friars, on the other hand,
was to mingle with their fellow-men and to spend their lives in active
religious work among them. Whereas the old monasticism had been
essentially selfish, the new movement was above all of a missionary and
philanthropic character. In the second place, the friars were even more
strongly committed to a life of poverty than were the monks, for they
renounced not only individual property, as did the monks, but also collective
property, as the monks did not. They were expected to get their
living either by their own labor or by begging. They did not dwell in
fixed abodes, but wandered hither and thither as inclination and duty
led. Their particular sphere of activity was the populous towns; unlike
the monks, they had no liking for rural solitudes. As one writer has
put it, "their houses were built in or near the great towns; and to the
majority of the brethren the houses of the orders were mere temporary
resting-places from which they issued to make their journeys through
town and country, preaching in the parish churches, or from the steps of
the market-crosses, and carrying their ministrations to every castle
and every cottage."</p>

<p>Both the Franciscans and the Dominicans were exempt from control
by the bishops in the various dioceses and were ardent supporters of
the papacy, which showered privileges upon them and secured in
them two of its strongest allies. The organization of each order
was elaborate and centralized. At the head was a master, or
general, who resided at Rome and was assisted by a "chapter." All
Christendom was divided into provinces, each of which was directed
by a prior and provincial chapter. And over each individual "house"
was placed a prior, or warden, appointed by the provincial chapter.
In their earlier history the zeal and achievements of the friars were
remarkable. Nearly all of the greatest men of the thirteenth and early
fourteenth centuries&mdash;as Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas, Dun Scotus,
and Albertus Magnus&mdash;were members of one of the mendicant orders.
Unfortunately, with the friars as with the monks, prosperity brought
decadence; and by the middle of the fourteenth century their ardor had
cooled and their boasted self-denial had pretty largely given place to self-indulgence.

<h4>63. The Life of St. Francis</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Saint Francis, the founder of the Franciscan order, was born,
probably in 1182, at Assisi, a small town in central Italy. His boyhood
was unpromising, but when he was about twenty years of age a great
change came over him, the final result of which was the making of one
of the most splendid and altogether lovable characters of the entire
Middle Ages. From a wild, reckless, although cultured, youth he developed
into a sympathetic, self-denying, sweet-spirited saint. Finding
himself, after his conversion, possessed of a natural loathing for the
destitute and diseased, especially lepers, he disciplined himself until he
could actually take a certain sort of pleasure in associating with these
outcasts of society. When his father, a wealthy and aristocratic cloth-merchant,
protested against this sort of conduct, the young man
promptly cast aside his gentlemanly raiment, clad himself in the worn-out
garments of a gardener, and adopted the life of the wandering
hermit. In 1209, in obedience to what he conceived to be a direct commission
from heaven, he began definitely to imitate the early apostles
in his manner of living and to preach the gospel of the older and purer
Christianity. By 1210 he had a small body of followers, and in that year
he sought and obtained Pope Innocent III.'s sanction of his work,
though the papal approval was expressed only orally and more than a
decade was to elapse before the movement received formal recognition.
About 1217 Francis and his companions took up missionary work on a
large scale. Members of the brotherhood were dispatched to England,
Germany, France, Spain, Hungary, and several other countries, with
instructions to spread the principles which by this time were coming
to be recognized as peculiarly Franciscan. The success of these efforts
was considerable, though in some places the brethren were ill treated and
an appeal had to be made to the Pope for protection.</p>

<p>The several selections given below have been chosen to illustrate the
principal features of the life and character of St. Francis. We are
fortunate in possessing a considerable amount of literature, contemporary
or nearly so, relating to the personal career of this noteworthy
man. In the first place, we have some writings of St. Francis himself&mdash;the
Rule (<a href="#Page_373">p. 373</a>), the Will (<a href="#Page_376">p. 376</a>), some poems, some reported sermons,
and fragments of a few letters. Then we have several biographies, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
which the most valuable, because not only the earliest but also the least
conventional, are the <i>Mirror of Perfection</i> and the <i>Legend of the Three
Companions</i>. These were written by men who knew St. Francis intimately
and who could avow "we who were with him have heard him
say" or "we who were with him have seen," such and such things. The
"three companions" were Brothers Leo, Rufinus, and Angelo&mdash;all men of
noble birth, the last-named being the first soldier to be identified with
the order. The <i>Mirror of Perfection</i> was written in 1227 by Brother Leo,
who of all men probably knew St. Francis best. It is a vivid and fascinating
portrait drawn from life. The <i>Legend of the Three Companions</i>
was written in 1246. The later biographies, such as the
official <i>Life</i> by St. Bonaventura (1261) and the <i>Little Flowers of St.
Francis</i> (written probably in the fourteenth century), though until recently
the best known of the group, are relatively inferior in value.
In them the real St. Francis is conventionalized and much obscured.</p>

<p>Francis, born in the city of Assisi, which lies in the confines
of the Vale of Spoleto, was at first named John by his mother.
Then, when his father, in whose absence he had been born, returned
from France, he was afterward named Francis<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>. After
he was grown up, and had become of a subtle wit, he practiced
the art of his father, that is, trade. But [he did so] in a very
different manner, for he was a merrier man than was his father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
and more generous, given to jests and songs, going about the
city of Assisi day and night in company with his kind, most
free-handed in spending; insomuch that he consumed all his
income and his profits in banquets and other matters. On this
<span class="sidebar">His youthful
vanities and
waywardness</span>
account he was often rebuked by his parents,
who told him he ran into so great expense on
himself and on others that he seemed to be no
son of theirs, but rather of some mighty prince. Nevertheless,
because his parents were rich and loved him most tenderly, they
bore with him in such matters, not being disposed to chastise
him. Indeed, his mother, when gossip arose among the neighbors
concerning his prodigal ways, made answer: "What think
ye of my son? He shall yet be the son of God by grace." But
he himself was free-handed, or rather prodigal, not only in these
things, but even in his clothes he was beyond measure sumptuous,
using stuffs more costly than it befitted him to wear. So wayward
was his fancy that at times on the same coat he would
cause a costly cloth to be matched with one of the meanest sort.</p>

<p>Yet he was naturally courteous, in manner and word, after
the purpose of his heart, never speaking a harmful or shameful
word to any one. Nay, indeed, although he was so gay and
wanton a youth, yet of set purpose would he make no reply to
those who said shameful things to him. And hence was his
fame so spread abroad throughout the whole neighborhood that
<span class="sidebar">His redeeming
qualities</span>
it was said by many who knew him that he
would do something great. By these steps of
godliness he progressed to such grace that he would say in communing
with himself: "Seeing that thou art bountiful and
courteous toward men, from whom thou receivest naught save
a passing and empty favor, it is just that thou shouldst be
courteous and bountiful toward God, who is Himself most
bountiful in rewarding His poor." Wherefore thenceforward
did he look with goodwill upon the poor, bestowing alms upon
them abundantly. And although he was a merchant, yet was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
he a most lavish dispenser of this world's riches. One day, when
he was standing in the warehouse in which he sold goods, and
was intent on business, a certain poor man came to him asking
alms for the love of God. Nevertheless, he was held back by
the covetousness of wealth and the cares of merchandise, and
<span class="sidebar">A lesson in
charity</span>
denied him the alms. But forthwith, being looked
upon by the divine grace, he rebuked himself of
great churlishness, saying, "Had this poor man asked thee
aught in the name of a great count or baron, assuredly thou
wouldst have given him what he had asked. How much more
then oughtest thou to have done it for the King of Kings and
Lord of all?" By reason whereof he thenceforth determined
in his heart never again to deny anything asked in the name of
so great a Lord....</p>

<p>Now, not many days after he returned to Assisi,<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> he was
chosen one evening by his comrades as their master of the revels,
to spend the money collected from the company after his own
fancy. So he caused a sumptuous banquet to be made ready,
as he had often done before. And when they came forth from
the house, and his comrades together went before him, going
through the city singing while he carried a wand in his hand
as their master, he was walking behind them, not singing, but
meditating very earnestly. And lo! suddenly he was visited
by the Lord, and his heart was filled with such sweetness that
he could neither speak nor move; nor was he able to feel and
<span class="sidebar">A vision in
the midst of
revelry</span>
hear anything except that sweetness only, which
so separated him from his physical senses that&mdash;as
he himself afterward said&mdash;had he then been
pricked with knives all over at once, he could not have moved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
from the spot. But when his comrades looked back and saw
him thus far off from them, they returned to him in fear, staring
at him as one changed into another man. And they asked him,
"What were you thinking about, that you did not come along
with us? Perchance you were thinking of taking a wife." To
them he replied with a loud voice: "Truly have you spoken, for
I thought of taking to myself a bride nobler and richer and fairer
than ever you have seen." And they mocked at him. But this
he said not of his own accord, but inspired of God; for the bride
herself was true Religion, whom he took unto him, nobler,
richer, and fairer than others in her poverty.</p>

<p>And so from that hour he began to grow worthless in his own
eyes, and to despise those things he had formerly loved, although
not wholly so at once, for he was not yet entirely freed from the
vanity of the world. Nevertheless, withdrawing himself little by
little from the tumult of the world, he made it his study to
treasure up Jesus Christ in his inner man, and, hiding from the
eyes of mockers the pearl that he would fain buy at the price of
selling his all, he went oftentimes, and as it were in secret, daily
to prayer, being urged thereto by the foretaste of that sweetness
that had visited him more and more often, and compelled him
to come from the streets and other public places to prayer.
Although he had long done good unto the poor, yet from this
time forth he determined still more firmly in his heart never
<span class="sidebar">His increasing
zeal in charity</span>
again to deny alms to any poor man who should
ask it for the love of God, but to give alms
more willingly and bountifully than had been his practice.
Whenever, therefore, any poor man asked of him an alms
out of doors, he would supply him with money if he could;
if he had no ready money, he would give him his cap or girdle
rather than send the poor man away empty. And if it happened
that he had nothing of this kind, he would go to some hidden
place, and strip off his shirt, and send the poor man thither that
he might take it, for the sake of God. He also would buy vessels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
for the adornment of churches, and would send them in all
secrecy to poor priests....</p>

<p>So changed, then, was he by divine grace (although still in
the secular garb) that he desired to be in some city where he
might, as one unknown, strip off his own clothes and exchange
them for those of some beggar, so that he might wear his instead
and make trial of himself by asking alms for the love of God.
Now it happened that at that time he had gone to Rome on a
pilgrimage. And entering the church of St. Peter, he reflected
on the offerings of certain people, seeing that they were small,
and spoke within himself: "Since the Prince of the Apostles
should of right be magnificently honored, why do these folk
make such sorry offerings in the church wherein his body rests?"
And so in great fervency he put his hand into his purse and drew
it forth full of money, and flung it through the grating of the
altar with such a crash that all who were standing by marveled
greatly at so splendid an offering. Then, going forth in front
of the doors of the church, where many beggars were gathered
to ask alms, he secretly borrowed the rags of one among the
<span class="sidebar">He begs alms
at Rome</span>
neediest and donned them, laying aside his own
clothing. Then, standing on the church steps
with the other beggars, he asked an alms in French, for he loved
to speak the French tongue, although he did not speak it correctly.
Thereafter, putting off the rags, and taking again his
own clothes, he returned to Assisi, and began to pray the Lord
to direct his way. For he revealed unto none his secret, nor
took counsel of any in this matter, save only of God (who had
begun to direct his way) and at times of the bishop of Assisi.
For at that time no true Poverty was to be found anywhere, and
she it was that he desired above all things of this world, being
minded in her to live&mdash;yea, and to die....</p>

<p>Now when on a certain day he was praying fervently unto the
Lord, answer was made unto him: "Francis, all those things that
thou hast loved after the flesh, and hast desired to have, thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
must needs despise and hate, if thou wouldst do My will, and
after thou shalt have begun to do this the things that aforetime
seemed sweet unto thee and delightful shall be unbearable unto
thee and bitter, and from those that aforetime thou didst loathe
thou shalt drink great sweetness and delight unmeasured."
Rejoicing at these words, and consoled in the Lord, when he
<span class="sidebar">Francis and
the leper</span>
had ridden nigh unto Assisi, he met one that was
a leper. And because he had been accustomed
greatly to loathe lepers, he did violence to himself, and dismounted
from his horse, gave him money, and kissed his hand.
And receiving from him the kiss of peace, he remounted his
horse and continued his journey. Thenceforth he began more
and more to despise himself, until by the grace of God he had
attained perfect mastery over himself.</p>

<p>A few days later, he took much money and went to the quarter
of the lepers, and, gathering all together, gave to each an alms,
kissing his hand. As he departed, in very truth that which had
aforetime been bitter to him, that is, the sight and touch of
lepers, was changed into sweetness. For, as he confessed, the
sight of lepers had been so grievous to him that he had been
accustomed to avoid not only seeing them, but even going near
their dwellings. And if at any time he happened to pass their
abodes, or to see them, although he was moved by compassion
to give them an alms through another person, yet always would
he turn aside his face, stopping his nostrils with his hand. But,
through the grace of God, he became so intimate a friend of the
lepers that, even as he recorded in his Will,<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> he lived with them
and did humbly serve them.</p>

<p class="center">(b)</p>

<p>A very spiritual friar, who was familiar with Blessed Francis,
erected at the hermitage where he lived a little cell in a solitary
spot, where Blessed Francis could retire and pray when he came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
thither. When he arrived at this place the friar took him to the
cell, and Blessed Francis said, "This cell is too splendid"&mdash;it
<span class="sidebar">How St. Francis
would not
dwell in an
adorned cell</span>
was, indeed, built only of wood, and smoothed
with a hatchet&mdash;"if you wish me to remain here,
make it within and without of branches of trees
and clay." For the poorer the house or cell, the more was he
pleased to live therein. When the friar had done this, Blessed
Francis remained there several days. One day he was out of the
cell when a friar came to see him, who, coming thereafter to the
place where Blessed Francis was, was asked, "Whence came
you, Brother?" He answered, "I come from your cell." Then
said Blessed Francis: "Since you have called it mine, let another
dwell there and not I." And, in truth, we who were with him
often heard him say: "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the
<span class="sidebar">Or in a cell
called his
own</span>
air have their nests, but the Son of Man hath
not where to lay His head." And again he would
say: "When the Lord remained in the desert, and
fasted forty days and forty nights, He did not make for Himself
a cell or a house, but found shelter amongst the rocks of the
mountain." For this reason, and to follow His example, he
would not have it said that a cell or house was his, nor would he
allow such to be constructed.... When he was nigh unto
death he caused it to be written in his Testament<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> that all the
cells and houses of the friars should be of wood and clay, the
better to safeguard poverty and humility.</p>

<p class="p2">At the beginning of the Order, when the friars were at Rivo-Torto,<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
near Assisi, there was among them one friar who would
<span class="sidebar">A lazy
friar</span>
not pray, work, nor ask for alms, but only eat.
Considering this, Blessed Francis knew by the Holy
Spirit that he was a carnal man, and said to him, "Brother Fly, go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
your way, since you consume the labor of the brethren, and are
slothful in the work of the Lord, like the idle and barren drone who
earns nothing and does not work, but consumes the labor and earnings
of the working bee." He, therefore, went his way, and as
he was a carnally-minded man he neither sought for mercy nor
obtained it.</p>

<p class="p2">Having at a time suffered greatly from one of his serious
attacks of illness, when he felt a little better he began to think
that during his sickness he had exceeded his usual allowance of
food, whereas he had really eaten very little. Though not quite
recovered from the ague, he caused the people of Assisi to be
called together in the public square to listen to a sermon. When
he had finished preaching, he told the people to remain where
they were until he came back to them, and entered the cathedral
of St. Rufinus with many friars and Brother Peter of Catana,
who had been a canon of that church, and was now the first
Minister-General<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> appointed by Blessed Francis. To Brother
<span class="sidebar">Public humiliation
inflicted
upon himself</span>
Peter Francis spoke, enjoining him under obedience
not to contradict what he was about to say.
Brother Peter replied: "Brother, neither is it
possible, as between you and me, nor do I wish to do anything
save what is pleasing to you." Then, taking off his tunic,
Blessed Francis bade him place a rope around his neck and drag
him thus before the people to the place where he had preached.
At the same time he ordered another friar to carry a bowlful
of ashes to the place, and when he got there to throw the ashes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
into his face. But this order was not obeyed by the friar out
of the pity and compassion he felt for him.</p>

<p>Brother Peter, taking the rope, did as he had been told; but
he and all the other friars shed tears of compassion and bitterness.
When he [Francis] stood thus bared before the people in
the place where he had preached, he cried: "You, and all those
who by my example have been induced to abandon the world
and enter Religion to lead the lives of friars, I confess before
God and you that in my illness I have eaten meat and broths
made of meat." And all the people could not refrain from weeping,
especially as at that time it was very cold and he had scarcely
recovered from the fever. Beating their breasts where they
stood, they exclaimed, "If this saint, for just and manifest necessity,
with shame of body thus accuses himself, whose life we know
to be holy, and who has imposed on himself such great abstinence
and austerity since his first conversion to Christ (whom
we here, as it were, see in the flesh), what will become of us sinners
who all our lifetime seek to follow our carnal appetites?"</p>

<p class="p2">Blessed Francis, wholly wrapped up in the love of God, discerned
perfectly the goodness of God not only in his own soul,
now adorned with the perfection of virtue, but in every creature.
On account of which he had a singular and intimate love of
<span class="sidebar">St. Francis
and the larks</span>
creatures, especially of those in which was figured
anything pertaining to God or the Order. Wherefore
above all other birds he loved a certain little bird which is
called the lark, or by the people, the cowled lark. And he used to
say of it: "Sister Lark hath a cowl like a Religious; and she is a
humble bird, because she goes willingly by the road to find there
any food. And if she comes upon it in foulness, she draws it out
and eats it. But, flying, she praises God very sweetly, like a good
Religious, despising earthly things, whose conversation is always
in the heavens, and whose intent is always to the praise of God.
Her clothes (that is, her feathers), are like to the earth and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
gives an example to Religious that they should not have delicate
and colored garments, but common in price and color, as earth
is commoner than the other elements." And because he perceived
this in them, he looked on them most willingly. Therefore
it pleased the Lord, that these most holy little birds should
show some sign of affection towards him in the hour of his
death. For late in the Sabbath day after vespers, before the
night in which he passed away to the Lord, a great multitude
of that kind of birds called larks came on the roof of the house
where he was lying, and, flying about, made a wheel like a circle
around the roof, and, sweetly singing, seemed likewise to praise
the Lord.</p>

<p class="p2">We who were with Blessed Francis and write these things,
testify that many times we heard him say: "If I could speak
with the Emperor,<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> I would supplicate and persuade him that,
for the love of God and me, he would make a special law that no
man should snare or kill our sisters, the larks, nor do them any
harm. Also, that all chief magistrates of cities and lords of
castles and villages should, every year, on the day of the Lord's
<span class="sidebar">His desire that
birds and animals
be fed on
Christmas day</span>
Nativity, compel men to scatter wheat and other
grain on the roads outside cities and castles, that
our Sister Larks and all other birds might have to
eat on that most solemn day; and that, out of reverence for the
Son of God, who on that night was laid by the most Blessed
Virgin Mary in a manger between an ox and an ass, all who have
oxen and asses should be obliged on that night to provide them
with abundant and good fodder; and also that on that day the
poor should be most bountifully fed by the rich."</p>

<p>For Blessed Francis held in higher reverence than any other
the Feast of the Lord's Nativity, saying, "After the Lord was
born, our salvation became a necessity." Therefore he desired
that on this day all Christians should rejoice in the Lord, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
for the love of Him who gave Himself for us, should generously
provide not only for the poor, but also for the beasts and birds.</p>

<p class="p2">Next to fire he most loved water, which is the symbol of holy
penance and tribulation, whereby the stains are washed from
the soul, and by which the first cleansing of the soul takes place
in holy baptism. Hence, when he washed his hands, he would
select a place where he would not tread the water underfoot.
<span class="sidebar">His regard for
trees, stones,
and all created
things</span>
When he walked over stones he would tread on
them with fear and reverence, for the love of
Him who is called the Rock, and when reciting
the words of the Psalm, <i>Thou hast exalted me on a rock</i>, would
add with great reverence and devotion, "beneath the foot of
the rock hast thou exalted me."</p>

<p>In the same way he would tell the friars who cut and prepared
the wood not to cut down the whole tree, but only such
branches as would leave the tree standing, for love of Him who
died for us on the wood of the Cross. So, also, he would tell the
friar who was the gardener not to cultivate all the ground for
vegetables and herbs for food, but to set aside some part to
produce green plants which should in their time bear flowers
for the friars, for love of Him who was called "The Flower of
the Field," and "The Lily of the Valley." Indeed he would say
the Brother Gardener should always make a beautiful little
garden in some part of the land, and plant it with sweet-scented
herbs bearing lovely flowers, which in the time of their blossoming
invited men to praise Him who made all herbs and flowers.
For every creature cries aloud: "God has made me for thee, O
man!"</p>

<h4>64. The Rule of St. Francis</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>There is every reason for believing that St. Francis set out upon his
mission with no idea whatever of founding a new religious order. His
fundamental purpose was to revive what he conceived to be the purer
Christianity of the apostolic age, and so far as this involved the announcement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
of any definite principles or rules he was quite content to draw
them solely from the Scriptures. We have record, for example, of how
when (in 1209) St. Francis had yet but two followers, he led them to the
steps of the church of St. Nicholas at Assisi and there read to them
three times the words of Jesus sending forth his disciples,<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> adding,
"This, brethren, is our life and our rule, and that of all who may join us.
Go, then, and do as you have heard." As his field of labor expanded,
however, and the number of the friars increased, St. Francis decided to
write out a definite Rule for the brotherhood and go to Rome to procure
its approval by the Pope. The Rule as thus formulated, in 1210, has not
come down to us. We know only that it was extremely simple and that
it was composed almost wholly of passages from the Bible (doubtless
those read to the companions at Assisi), with a few precepts about the
occupations and manner of living of the brethren. This first Rule indeed
proved too simple and brief to satisfy the demands of the growing order.
A general injunction, such as "be poor," was harder to apply and to
live up to than a more specific set of instructions explaining just what
was to be considered poverty and what was not. The brethren, moreover,
were soon preaching and laboring in all the countries of western
Europe and questions were continually coming up regarding their relations
with the temporal powers in those countries, with the local clergy,
with the papal government, and also among themselves.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, and with a heart-felt warning against the insidious
influences of ambition and organization, the founder finally brought himself
to the task of drawing up a constitution for the order which had surprised
him, and in a certain sense grieved him, by the very elaborateness
of its development. During the winter of 1220-21, when physical infirmities
were foreshadowing the end, Francis worked out the document generally
known as the Rule of 1221, which became the basis for the Rule of
1223, quoted in part below. Before the Rule took its final form, the influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
of the Church was brought to bear through the papacy, with the
result that most of the freshness and vigor that St. Francis put into the
earlier effort was crushed out in the interest of ecclesiastical regularity.
Only a small portion of the document can be reproduced here, but
enough, perhaps, to show something as to what the manner of life of the
Franciscan friar was expected to be. The extract may profitably be
compared with the Benedictine Rule governing the monks [see <a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a>].</p>

<p><b>1.</b> This is the rule and way of living of the Minorite brothers,
namely, to observe the holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,

Brother Francis promises obedience and reverence to our lord
Pope Honorius,<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> and to his successors who canonically enter
upon their office, and to the Roman Church. And the other
brothers shall be bound to obey Brother Francis and his successors.</p>

neither coin nor money.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Those brothers to whom God has given the ability to labor
shall labor faithfully and devoutly, in such manner that idleness,

a reward, moreover, for their labor, they may receive for themselves

and their brothers the necessities of life, but not coin or
money; and this humbly, as becomes the servants of God and
the followers of most holy poverty.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> The brothers shall appropriate nothing to themselves,
neither a house, nor a place, nor anything; but as pilgrims and
strangers in this world, in poverty and humility serving God,
they shall confidently go seeking for alms. Nor need they be
ashamed, for the Lord made Himself poor for us in this world.</p>

<h4>65. The Will of St. Francis</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The will which St. Francis prepared just before his death (1226)
contains an admirable statement of the principles for which he labored,
as well as a notable warning to his successors not to allow the order to
fall away from its original high ideals. Among the later Franciscans
the Will acquired a moral authority superior even to that of the Rule.</p>
</div>

Companions"], Appendix, p. 110. Translation adapted from Paul
Sabatier, <i>Life of St. Francis of Assisi</i> (New York, 1894), pp. 337-339.</p>

<p>God gave it to me, Brother Francis, to begin to do penance in
the following manner: when I was yet in my sins it seemed to me
too painful to look upon the lepers, but the Lord Himself led
me among them, and I had compassion upon them. When I
left them, that which had seemed to me bitter had become sweet
and easy. A little while after, I left the world,<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> and God gave
me such faith that I would kneel down with simplicity in any
of his churches, and I would say, "We adore thee, Lord Jesus
Christ, here and in all thy churches which are in the world, and
we bless thee that by Thy holy cross Thou hast ransomed the
world."</p>

<p>Afterward the Lord gave me, and still gives me, so great a
faith in priests who live according to the form of the holy Roman
Church, because of their sacerdotal character, that even if they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
persecuted me I would have recourse to them, and even though
I had all the wisdom of Solomon, if I should find poor secular
<span class="sidebar">St. Francis not
hostile to the
existing Church</span>
priests, I would not preach in their parishes
against their will.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> I desire to respect them like
all the others, to love them and honor them as
my lords. I will not consider their sins, for in them I see the
Son of God, and they are my lords. I do this because here below
I see nothing, I perceive nothing physically of the most high
Son of God, except His most holy body and blood, which the
priests receive and alone distribute to others.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>I desire above all things to honor and venerate all these most
holy mysteries and to keep them precious. Wherever I find the
sacred name of Jesus, or his words, in unsuitable places, I desire
to take them away and put them in some decent place; and I
pray that others may do the same. We ought to honor and
revere all the theologians and those who preach the most holy
word of God, as dispensing to us spirit and life.</p>

<p>When the Lord gave me the care of some brothers, no one
showed me what I ought to do, but the Most High himself revealed
to me that I ought to live according to the model of the
holy gospel. I caused a short and simple formula to be written
and the lord Pope confirmed it for me.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>Those who volunteered to follow this kind of life distributed
all they had to the poor. They contented themselves with
<span class="sidebar">Poverty and
labor enjoined</span>
one tunic, patched within and without, with
the cord and breeches, and we desired to have
nothing more.... We loved to live in poor and abandoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
churches, and we were ignorant and were submissive to all.
I worked with my hands and would still do so, and I firmly
desire also that all the other brothers work, for this makes for
goodness. Let those who know no trade learn one, not for the
purpose of receiving wages for their toil, but for their good
example and to escape idleness. And when we are not given the
price of our work, let us resort to the table of the Lord, begging
our bread from door to door. The Lord revealed to me the
salutation which we ought to give: "God give you peace!"</p>

<p>Let the brothers take great care not to accept churches,
dwellings, or any buildings erected for them, except as all is
in accordance with the holy poverty which we have vowed in
the Rule; and let them not live in them except as strangers and
pilgrims. I absolutely forbid all the brothers, in whatsoever
place they may be found, to ask any bull from the court of
<span class="sidebar">No further
privileges
to be sought
from the Pope</span>
Rome, whether directly or indirectly, in the interest
of church or convent, or under pretext of
preaching, or even for the protection of their
bodies. If they are not received anywhere, let them go of themselves
elsewhere, thus doing penance with the benediction of
God....</p>

<p>And let the brothers not say, "This is a new Rule"; for this is
only a reminder, a warning, an exhortation. It is my last will
and testament, that I, little Brother Francis, make for you, my
blessed brothers, in order that we may observe in a more Catholic
way the Rule which we promised the Lord to keep.</p>

<p>Let the ministers-general, all the other ministers, and the
custodians be held by obedience to add nothing to and take
<span class="sidebar">No additions
to be made to
the Rule or
the Will</span>
nothing away from these words. Let them always
keep this writing near them beside the Rule; and
in all the assemblies which shall be held, when
the Rule is read, let these words be read also.</p>

<p>I absolutely forbid all the brothers, clerics and laymen, to
introduce comments in the Rule, or in this Will, under pretext
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
of explaining it. But since the Lord has given me to speak and
to write the Rule and these words in a clear and simple manner,
so do you understand them in the same way without commentary,
and put them in practice until the end.</p>

<p>And whoever shall have observed these things, may he be
crowned in heaven with the blessings of the heavenly Father,
and on earth with those of his well-beloved Son and of the Holy
Spirit, the Consoler, with the assistance of all the heavenly
virtues and all the saints.</p>

<p>And I, little Brother Francis, your servant, confirm to you,
so far as I am able, this most holy benediction. Amen.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
THE PAPACY AND THE TEMPORAL POWERS IN THE LATER
MIDDLE AGES</h3>

<h4>66. The Interdict Laid on France by Innocent III. (1200)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Two of the most effective weapons at the service of the mediæval
Church were excommunication and the interdict. By the ban of excommunication
the proper ecclesiastical authorities could exclude a
heretic or otherwise objectionable person from all religious privileges,
thereby cutting him off from association with the faithful and consigning
him irrevocably (unless he repented) to Satan. The interdict differed
from excommunication in being less sweeping in its condemnatory character,
and also in being applied to towns, provinces, or countries rather
than to individuals. As a rule the interdict undertook to deprive the
inhabitants of a specified region of the use of certain of the sacraments,
of participation in the usual religious services, and of the right of Christian
burial. It did not expel men from church membership, as did
excommunication, but it suspended most of the privileges and rights
flowing from such membership. The interdict was first employed by the
clergy of north France in the tenth and eleventh centuries. In the
twelfth it was adopted by the papacy on account of its obvious value
as a means of disciplining the monarchs of western Europe. Because
of its effectiveness in stirring up popular indignation against sovereigns
who incurred the papal displeasure, by the time of Innocent III. (1198-1216)
it had come to be employed for political as well as for purely
religious purposes, though generally the two considerations were closely
intertwined. A famous and typical instance of its use was that of the
year 1200, described below.</p>

<p>In August, 1193, Philip Augustus, king of France, married Ingeborg,
second sister of King Knut VI. of Denmark. At the time Philip was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
contemplating an invasion of England and hoped through the marriage
to assure himself of Danish aid. Circumstances soon changed his plans,
however, and almost immediately he began to treat his new wife coldly,
with the obvious purpose of forcing her to return to her brother's court.
Failing in this, he convened his nobles and bishops at Compiègne and
got from them a decree of divorce, on the flimsy pretext that the marriage
with Ingeborg had been illegal on account of the latter's distant
relationship to Elizabeth of Hainault, Philip's first wife. Ingeborg
and her brother appealed to Rome, and Pope Celestine III. dispatched
letter after letter and legate after legate to the French court, but without
result. Indeed, after three years, Philip, to clinch the matter, as he
thought, married Agnes of Meran, daughter of a Bavarian nobleman,
and shut up Ingeborg in a convent at Soissons. In 1198, while the
affair stood thus, Celestine died and was succeeded by Innocent III.,
under whom the papal power was destined to attain a height hitherto
unknown. Innocent flatly refused to sanction the divorce or to recognize
the second marriage, although he was not pope, of course, until
some years after both had occurred. On the ground that the whole
subject of marriage lay properly within the jurisdiction of the Church,
Innocent demanded that Philip cast off the beautiful Agnes and
restore Ingeborg to her rightful place. This Philip promptly refused
to do.</p>

<p>The threat of an interdict failing to move him, the Pope proceeded to
put his threat into execution. In January, 1200, the interdict was pronounced
and, though the king's power over the French clergy was so
strong that many refused to heed the voice from Rome, gradually
the discontent and indignation of the people grew until after nine
months it became apparent that the king must yield. He did so as
gracefully as he could, promising to take back Ingeborg and submit
the question of a divorce to a council presided over by the papal legate.
This council, convened in 1201 at Soissons, decided against the king and
in favor of Ingeborg; but Philip had no intention to submit in good
faith and, until the death of Agnes in 1204, he maintained his policy of
procrastination and double-dealing. Even in the later years of the reign
the unfortunate Ingeborg had frequent cause to complain of harshness
and neglect at the hand of her royal husband.</p>

<p>The following are the principal portions of Innocent's interdict.

<h4>67. The Bull "Unam Sanctam" of Boniface VIII. (1302)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In the history of the mediæval Church at least three great periods of
conflict between the papacy and the temporal powers can be distinguished.
The first was the era of Gregory VII. and Henry IV. of Germany
[see <a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>]; the second was that of Innocent III. and John of
England and Philip Augustus of France [see <a href="#Page_380">p. 380</a>]; the third was that
of Boniface VIII. and Philip the Fair of France. In many respects the
most significant document pertaining to the last of these struggles is
the papal bull, given below, commonly designated by its opening words,
<i>Unam Sanctam</i>.</p>

<p>The question at issue in the conflict of Boniface VIII. and Philip the
Fair was the old one as to whether the papacy should be allowed to
dominate European states in temporal as well as in spiritual matters.
The Franconian emperors, in the eleventh century, made stubborn
resistance to such domination, but the immediate result was only partial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
success, while later efforts to keep up the contest practically ruined the
power of the house of Hohenstaufen. Even Philip Augustus, at the
opening of the thirteenth century, had been compelled to yield, at least
outwardly, to the demands of the papacy respecting his marriages
and his national policies. With the revival of the issue under Boniface
and Philip, however, the tide turned, for at last there had arisen
a nation whose sovereign had so firm a grip upon the loyalty of his subjects
that he could defy even the power of Rome with impunity.</p>

<p>The quarrel between Boniface and Philip first assumed importance
in 1296&mdash;two years after the accession of the former and eleven after
that of the latter. The immediate subject of dispute was the heavy
taxes which Philip was levying upon the clergy of France and the
revenues from which he was using in the prosecution of his wars with
Edward I. of England; but royal and papal interests were fundamentally
at variance and as both king and pope were of a combative temper, a
conflict was inevitable, irrespective of taxes or any other particular
cause of controversy. In 1096 Boniface issued the famous bull <i>Clericis
Laicos</i>, forbidding laymen (including monarchs) to levy subsidies on the
clergy without papal consent and prohibiting the clergy to pay subsidies
so levied. Philip the Fair was not mentioned in the bull, but the
measure was clearly directed primarily at him. He retaliated by prohibiting
the export of money, plate, etc., from the realm, thereby cutting
off the accustomed papal revenues from France. In 1297 an apparent
reconciliation was effected, the Pope practically suspending the
bull so far as France was concerned, though only to secure relief from
the conflict with Philip while engaged in a struggle with the rival Colonna
family at Rome.</p>

<p>In 1301 the contest was renewed, mainly because of the indiscretion
of a papal legate, Bernard Saisset, bishop of Pamiers, who vilified the
king and was promptly imprisoned for his violent language. Boniface
took up the cause of Saisset and called an ecclesiastical council to regulate
the affairs of church and state in France and to rectify the injuries
wrought by King Philip. The claim to papal supremacy in temporal as
well as spiritual affairs, which Boniface proposed thus to make good,
was boldly stated in a new bull&mdash;that of <i>Ausculta Fili</i>&mdash;in 1301. At the
same time the bull <i>Clericis Laicos</i> was renewed for France. Philip knew
that the Franconians and his own Capetian predecessors had failed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
their struggles with Rome chiefly for the reason that they had been
lacking in consistent popular support. National feeling was unquestionably
stronger in the France of 1301 than in the Germany of 1077, or even
in the France of 1200; but to make doubly sure, Philip, in 1302, caused
the first meeting of a complete States General to be held, and from this
body, representing the various elements of the French people, he got
reliable pledges of support in his efforts to resist the temporal aggressions
of the papacy. It was at this juncture that Boniface issued the bull
<i>Unam Sanctam</i>, which has well been termed the classic mediæval expression
of the papal claims to universal temporal sovereignty.</p>

<p>In 1303 an assembly of French prelates and magnates, under the
inspiration of Philip, brought charges of heresy and misconduct against
Boniface and called for a meeting of a general ecclesiastical council to
depose him. Boniface decided to issue a bull excommunicating and
deposing Philip. But before the date set for this step (September, 1303)
a catastrophe befell the papacy which resulted in an unexpected termination
of the episode. On the day before the bull of deposition was to
be issued William of Nogaret, whom Philip had sent to Rome to force
Boniface to call a general council to try the charges against himself,
led a band of troops to Anagni and took the Pope prisoner with the intention
of carrying him to France for trial. After three days the inhabitants
of Anagni attacked the Frenchmen and drove them out and
Boniface, who had barely escaped death, returned to Rome. The unfortunate
Pope never recovered, however, from the effects of the outrage
and his death in October (1303) left Philip, by however unworthy
means, a victor. From this point the papacy passes under the domination
of the French court and in 1309 began the dark period of the so-called
Babylonian Captivity, during most of which the popes dwelt at
Avignon under conditions precisely the reverse of the ideal which Boniface
so clearly asserted in <i>Unam Sanctam</i>.</p>

<p>The true faith compels us to believe that there is one holy
Catholic Apostolic Church, and this we firmly believe and plainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
confess. And outside of her there is no salvation or remission
of sins, as the Bridegroom says in the Song of Solomon: "My
dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother,
she is the choice one of her that bare her" [Song of Sol., vi. 9];
which represents the one mystical body, whose head is Christ,
but the head of Christ is God [1 Cor., xi. 3]. In this Church there
<span class="sidebar">An assertion
of the unity
of the Church</span>
is "one Lord, one faith, one baptism" [Eph.,
iv. 5]. For in the time of the flood there was only
one ark, that of Noah, prefiguring the one Church,
and it was "finished above in one cubit" [Gen., vi. 16], and had
but one helmsman and master, namely, Noah. And we read
that all things on the earth outside of this ark were destroyed.
This Church we venerate as the only one, since the Lord said by
the prophet: "Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from
the power of the dog" [Ps., xxii. 20]. He prayed for his soul, that
is, for himself, the head; and at the same time for the body, and
he named his body, that is, the one Church, because there is but
one Bridegroom [John, iii. 29], and because of the unity of the
faith, of the sacraments, and of his love for the Church. This
is the seamless robe of the Lord which was not rent but parted
by lot [John, xix. 23].</p>

<p>Therefore there is one body of the one and only Church, and
one head, not two heads, as if the Church were a monster. And
this head is Christ, and his vicar, Peter and his successor; for the
Lord himself said to Peter: "Feed my sheep" [John, xxi. 16].
And he said "my sheep," in general, not these or those sheep in
particular; from which it is clear that all were committed to him.
<span class="sidebar">An allusion to
the Petrine
Supremacy</span>
If, therefore, Greeks [i.e., the Greek Church] or
any one else say that they are not subject to Peter
and his successors, they thereby necessarily confess
that they are not of the sheep of Christ. For the Lord says,
in the Gospel of John, that there is one fold and only one shepherd
[John, x. 16]. By the words of the gospel we are taught that
the two swords, namely, the spiritual authority and the temporal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
are in the power of the Church. For when the apostles said
"Here are two swords" [Luke, xxii. 38]&mdash;that is, in the Church,
since it was the apostles who were speaking&mdash;the Lord did not
answer, "It is too much," but "It is enough." Whoever denies
that the temporal sword is in the power of Peter does not properly
understand the word of the Lord when He said: "Put up thy
sword into the sheath" [John, xviii. 11]. Both swords, therefore,
<span class="sidebar">The proper relation
of spiritual
and temporal
powers</span>
the spiritual and the temporal, are in the power
of the Church. The former is to be used by the
Church, the latter for the Church; the one by the
hand of the priest, the other by the hand of kings and knights,
but at the command and permission of the priest. Moreover, it
is necessary for one sword to be under the other, and the temporal
authority to be subjected to the spiritual; for the apostle
says, "For there is no power but of God: and the powers that be
are ordained of God" [Rom., xiii. 1]; but they would not be ordained
unless one were subjected to the other, and, as it were,
the lower made the higher by the other.</p>

<p>For, according to St. Dionysius,<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> it is a law of divinity that
the lowest is made the highest through the intermediate. According
to the law of the universe all things are not equally and
directly reduced to order, but the lowest are fitted into their
order through the intermediate, and the lower through the
higher. And we must necessarily admit that the spiritual power
<span class="sidebar">The superiority
of the
spiritual</span>
surpasses any earthly power in dignity and honor,
because spiritual things surpass temporal things.
We clearly see that this is true from the paying
of tithes, from the benediction, from the sanctification, from the
receiving of the power, and from the governing of these things.
For the truth itself declares that the spiritual power must
establish the temporal power and pass judgment on it if it is
not good. Thus the prophecy of Jeremiah concerning the Church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
and the ecclesiastical power is fulfilled: "See, I have this day
set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out,
and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build,
and to plant" [Jer., i. 10].</p>

<p>Therefore if the temporal power errs, it will be judged by the
spiritual power, and if the lower spiritual power errs, it will be
<span class="sidebar">The highest
spiritual power
(the papacy)
responsible to
God alone</span>
judged by its superior. But if the highest
spiritual power errs, it cannot be judged by
men, but by God alone. For the apostle says:
"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet
he himself is judged of no man" [1 Cor., ii. 15]. Now this authority,
although it is given to man and exercised through man,
is not human, but divine. For it was given by the word of the
Lord to Peter, and the rock was made firm to him and his successors,
in Christ himself, whom he had confessed. For the Lord
said to Peter: "Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be
bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall
be loosed in heaven" [Matt., xvi. 19].</p>

<p>Therefore, whosoever resisteth this power thus ordained of
God resisteth the ordinance of God [Rom., xiii. 2], unless there
are two principles [beginnings], as Manichæus<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> pretends there
are. But this we judge to be false and heretical. For Moses says
that, not in the beginnings, but in the beginning, God created
<span class="sidebar">Submission to
the papacy essential
to salvation</span>
the heaven and the earth [Gen., i. 1]. We therefore
declare, say, and affirm that submission on
the part of every man to the bishop of Rome is
altogether necessary for his salvation.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span></p>

<h4>68. The Great Schism and the Councils of Pisa and Constance</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The "Babylonian Captivity"&mdash;begun in 1305, or perhaps more properly
in 1309, when the French Pope, Clement V., took up his residence
regularly at Avignon&mdash;lasted until 1377. During these sixty or seventy
years the College of Cardinals consisted chiefly of Frenchmen, all of the
seven popes were of French nationality, and for the most part the
papal authority was little more than a tool in the hands of the aggressive
French sovereigns. In 1377, at the solicitation of the Italian clergy
and people, Pope Gregory XI. removed to Rome, where he died in 1378.
In the election that followed the Roman populace, determined to bring
the residence of the popes at Avignon to an end once for all, demanded a
Roman, or at least an Italian, pope. The majority of the cardinals were
French, but they could not agree upon a French candidate and, intimidated
by the threats of the mob, they at last chose a Neapolitan who
took the name Urban VI. A few months of Urban's obstinate administration
convinced the cardinals that they had made a serious mistake,
and, on the ground that their choice had been unduly influenced by
popular clamor, they sought to nullify the election and to replace Urban
by a Genevan who took the title Clement VII. Urban utterly refused
thus to be put aside, so that there were now two popes, each duly elected
by the College of Cardinals and each claiming the undivided allegiance
of Christendom. This was the beginning of the Great Schism, destined
to work havoc in the Church for a full generation, or until finally ended
in 1417. Clement VII. fixed his abode at Avignon and French influence
secured for him the support of Spain, Scotland, and Sicily. The rest of
Europe, displeased with the subordination of the papacy to France and
French interests, declared for Urban, who was pledged to maintain the
papal capital at Rome.</p>

<p>France must be held responsible in the main for the evils of the Great
Schism&mdash;a breach in the Church which she deliberately created and for
many years maintained; but she herself suffered by it more than any
other nation of Europe because of the annates,<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> the <i>décime</i>,<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
taxes which were imposed upon the French clergy and people to support
the luxurious and at times extravagant papal court at Avignon, or which
were exacted by ambitious monarchs under the cover of papal license.
In the course of time the impossible situation created by the Schism
demanded a remedy and in fairness it should be observed that in the
work of adjustment the leading part was taken by the French. After
the death of Clement VII., in 1394, the French court sincerely desired
to bring the Schism to an end on terms that would be fair to all. Already
in 1393 King Charles VI. had laid the case before the University
of Paris and asked for an opinion as to the best course to be pursued.
The authorities of the university requested each member of the various
faculties to submit his idea of a solution of the problem and from the
mass of suggestions thus brought together a committee of fifty-four
professors, masters, and doctors worked out the three lines of action
set forth in selection (a) below. The first plan, i.e., that both popes
should resign as a means of restoring harmony, was accepted as the
proper one by an assembly of the French clergy convened in 1395. It
was doomed to defeat, however, by the vacillation of both Benedict
XIII. at Avignon and Boniface IX. at Rome, and in the end it was
agreed to fall back upon the third plan which the University of Paris had
proposed, i.e., the convening of a general council. There was no doubt
that such a council could legally be summoned only by the pope, but
finally the cardinals attached to both popes deserted them and united
in issuing the call in their own name.</p>

<p>The council met at Pisa in 1409 and proceeded to clear up the question
of its own legality and authority by issuing the unequivocal declaration
comprised in (b) below. It furthermore declared both popes deposed and
elected a new one, who took the name Alexander V. Neither of the
previous popes, however, recognized the council's action, so now there
were three rivals instead of two and the situation was only so much
worse than before. In 1410 Alexander V. died and the cardinals chose
as his successor John XXIII., a man whose life was notoriously wicked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
but who was far from lacking in political sagacity. Three years later
the capture of Rome by the king of Naples forced John to appeal for
assistance to the Emperor Sigismund; and Sigismund demanded, before
extending the desired aid, that a general church council be summoned
to meet on German soil for the adjustment of the tangled papal situation.
The result was the Council of Constance, whose sessions extended
from November, 1414, to April, 1418, and which, because of its general
European character, was able to succeed where the Council of Pisa had
failed. In the decree <i>Sacrosancta</i> given below (c), issued in April,
1415, we have the council's notable assertion of its supreme authority
in ecclesiastical matters, even as against the pope himself. The
Schism was healed with comparative facility. Gregory XII., who
had been the pope at Rome, but who was now in exile, sent envoys
to offer his abdication. Benedict XIII., likewise a fugitive,
was deposed and found himself without supporters. John XXIII.
was deposed for his unworthy character and had no means of offering
resistance. The cardinals, together with representatives of the
five "nations" into which the council was divided, harmoniously selected
for pope a Roman cardinal, who assumed the name of Martin V. This
was in 1417. The Schism was at an end, though the work of combating
heresy and of propagating reform within the Church went on in successive
councils, notably that of Basel (1431-1449).</p>

<p><i>The first way.</i> Now the first way to end the Schism is that

they may have, or claim to have, to the papal office.</p>

<p><i>The second way.</i> But if both cling tenaciously to their rights
and refuse to resign, as they have thus far done, we would propose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
a resort to arbitration. That is, that they should together choose
worthy and suitable men, or permit such to be chosen in a

full power and authority to discuss the case and

matter should be left to a general council. This general council
might be composed, according to canon law, only of prelates; or,
since many of them are very illiterate, and many of them are
bitter partisans of one or the other pope, there might be joined
with the prelates an equal number of masters and doctors of
theology and law from the faculties of approved universities.
Or, if this does not seem sufficient to any one, there might be added,
besides, one or more representatives from cathedral chapters and
the chief monastic orders, to the end that all decisions might be
rendered only after most careful examination and mature deliberation.</p>

<h4>69. The Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (1438)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The Council of Basel, convened in 1431, had for its object a thoroughgoing
reformation of the Church, "in its head and its members," from
papacy to parish priest. Like all of the councils of the period, its spirit
was distinctly anti-papal and for this reason Pope Eugene IV. sought
to bring it under his control by transferring it to Bologna and, failing
in this, to turn its deliberations into channels other than criticism of
the papacy. While the negotiations of Eugene and the council were in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
progress a step fraught with great significance was taken in France in
the promulgation of the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> France was
the only country in which the principles laid down by the councils&mdash;Pisa,
Constance, Basel, and the rest&mdash;had taken firm hold. In 1438
Charles VII. convened at Bourges an assembly composed of leading prelates,
councillors, and princes of the royal blood, to which the Pope and
the Council of Basel both sent delegates. This assembly proceeded to
adapt the decrees of the council to the conditions and needs of France,
on the evident assumption that the will of the French magnates in such
matters was superior to that of both pope and council, so far as France
was concerned. The action at Bourges well illustrates the growing
spirit of French nationality which had sprung up since the recent
achievements of Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>The Pragmatic Sanction dealt in the main with four subjects&mdash;the
authority of church councils, the diminishing of papal patronage,
the restriction of papal taxation, and the limitation of appeals
to Rome. Together these matters are commonly spoken of as the
"Gallican liberties," i.e., the liberties of the Gallic or French church,
and they implied the right of the national church to administer its own
affairs with only the slightest interference from the pope or other outside
powers; in other words, they were essentially anti-papal. Louis XI., the
successor of Charles VII., for diplomatic reasons, sought to revoke the
Pragmatic Sanction, but the Parlement of Paris refused to register
the ordinance and for all practical purposes the Pragmatic was maintained
until 1516. In that year Francis I. established the relations of
the papacy and the French clergy on the basis of a new "concordat,"
which, however, was not very unlike the Pragmatic. The Pragmatic
is of interest to the student of French history mainly because of the degree
in which it enhanced the power of the crown, particularly in respect
to the ecclesiastical affairs of the realm, and because of the testimony
it bears to the declining influence of the papacy in the stronger
nations like France and England. The text printed below represents
only an abstract of the document, which in all included thirty-three
chapters.</p>

of the Church, in both its head and members, having had presented
to it numerous decrees and regulations, with the request
that it accept them and cause them to be observed in the kingdom,

that, from the falling into decay of the early

burdens; that the most notable and best endowed benefices have
fallen into the hands of unknown men, who do not conform at
all to the requirement of residence and who do not understand the
speech of the people committed to their care, and consequently
are neglectful of the needs of their souls, like mercenaries who
dream of nothing whatever but temporal gain; that thus the
worship of Christ is declining, piety is enfeebled, the laws of the
Church are violated, and buildings for religious uses are falling
in ruin. The clergy abandon their theological studies, because
there is no hope of advancement. Conflicts without number rage
over the possession of benefices, plurality of which is coveted by
an execrable ambition. Simony is everywhere glaring; the
prelates and other collators<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> are pillaged of their rights and their

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
THE EMPIRE IN THE TWELFTH, THIRTEENTH, AND FOURTEENTH
CENTURIES</h3>

<h4>70. The Peace of Constance (1183)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>With the election of Frederick Barbarossa as emperor, in 1152, a new
stage of the great papal-imperial combat was entered upon, though
under conditions quite different from those surrounding the contest in
the preceding century [see <a href="#Page_261">Chap. XVI]</a>. The Empire was destined to
succumb in the end to the papacy, but with a sovereign of Frederick's
energy and ability at its head it was able at least to make a stubborn
fight and to meet defeat with honor. The new reign was inaugurated by
a definite announcement of the Emperor's intention to consolidate and
strengthen the imperial government throughout all Germany and Italy.
The task in Germany was far from simple; in Italy it was the most formidable
that could have been conceived, and this for the reason that the
Italian population was largely gathered in cities with strong political
and military organization, with all the traditions of practical independence,
and with no thought of submitting to the government of an emperor
or any other claimant to more than merely nominal sovereignty.</p>

<p>Trouble began almost at once between Frederick and the free commune
of Milan, though war was averted for a time by the oaths taken to the
Emperor on the occasion of his first expedition across the Alps in 1154.
Between that date and 1158 the consuls of the city were detected in
treacherous conduct and, the people refusing to disavow them, in the
latter year the Emperor again crossed the Alps, bent on nothing less
than the annihilation of the commune and the dispersion of its inhabitants.
He carried with him a larger army than a head of the Holy
Roman Empire had ever led into Italy. The Milanese submitted, under
conditions extremely humiliating, and Frederick, after being assured
by the doctors of law at the new university of Bologna that he was acting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
quite within the letter of the Roman law, proceeded to lay claim to the
<i>regalia</i> (royal rights, such as tolls from roads and rivers, products of
mines, and the estates of criminals), to the right to levy an extraordinary
war tax, and to that of appointing the chief civic magistrates. Disaffection
broke out at once in many of the communes, but chiefly at
Milan; whereupon Frederick came promptly to the conclusion that the
time had arrived to rid himself of this irreconcilable opponent of his
measures. The city was besieged and, after its inhabitants had been
starved into surrender, almost completely destroyed (1162).</p>

<p>Only temporarily did the barbarous act have its intended effect; the
net result was a widespread revival of the communal spirit, which expressed
itself in the formation of a sturdy confederacy known as the
Lombard League. One of the League's first acts was to rebuild Milan,
under whose leadership the struggle with the Emperor was actively
renewed. In 1168 a new city was founded at the foot of the Alps near
Pavia to serve as a base of operations in the campaign which the League
proposed to wage against the common enemy. It was given the name
Alessandria (or Alexandria) in honor of Pope Alexander III., who was
friendly to the cause of the cities. In 1174 Frederick began an open
attack on the League, but in 1176, at Legnano, he suffered an overwhelming
defeat, due largely to his failure to receive reinforcements
from Germany. The adjustment of peace was intrusted to an assembly
at Venice in which all parties were represented. The result was the
treaty of Venice (1177), the advantages of which were wholly against the
Empire. A truce of six years was granted the cities, with the understanding
that all details were to be arranged within, or at the expiration
of, that time.</p>

<p>When the close of the period arrived, in 1183, Frederick no longer
dreamed of subduing and punishing the rebellious Italians, but instead
was quite ready to agree to a permanent peace. The result was
the Peace of Constance, which has been described as the earliest international
agreement of the kind in modern history. By this instrument
the theoretical overlordship of the Emperor in Italy was reasserted,
though in fact it had never been denied. Beyond this, however, the
communes were recognized as essentially independent. Those who had
enjoyed the right to choose their own magistrates retained it; their
financial obligations to the Emperor were clearly defined; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
League was conceded to be a legitimate and permanent organization.
By yielding on numerous vital points the Empire had vindicated its
right to exist, but its administrative machinery, so far as Italy was
concerned, was still further impaired. This machinery, it must be
said, had never been conspicuously effective south of the Alps. As
for Frederick, he set out in 1189 upon the Third Crusade, during the
course of which he met his death in Asia Minor without being permitted
to see the Holy Land.</p>

<h4>71. Current Rumors Concerning the Life and Character of Frederick II.</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Frederick II. (1194-1250), king of Naples and Sicily and emperor of
the Holy Roman Empire, was a son of Emperor Henry VI. and a grandson
of Frederick Barbarossa. When his father died (1197) it was intended
that the young child's uncle, Philip of Hohenstaufen, should
occupy the imperial throne temporarily as regent. Philip, however,
proceeded to assume the position as if in his own right and became engaged
in a deadly conflict with a rival claimant, Otto IV., during which
the Pope, Innocent III., fanned the flames of civil war and made the situation
contribute chiefly to the aggrandizement of papal authority in temporal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
affairs. In 1208 Philip was assassinated and in the following year
Otto received the imperial crown at Rome. Almost immediately, however,
disagreement broke out between the Pope and the new Emperor,
chiefly because of the latter's ambition to become king of Sicily. Repenting
that he had befriended Otto, Innocent promptly excommunicated
him and set on foot a movement&mdash;in which he enlisted the services
of Philip Augustus of France&mdash;to supplant the obnoxious Emperor by
Frederick of Sicily (the later Frederick II.). Otto was a nephew of
Richard I. and John of England and the latter was easily persuaded to
enter into an alliance with him against the papal-French-Sicilian combination.
The result was the battle of Bouvines [see <a href="#Page_297">p. 297</a>], in 1214,
in which John and Otto were hopelessly defeated. Meanwhile, in 1212,
Frederick had received a secret embassy from Otto's discontented subjects
in Germany, offering him the imperial crown if he would come and
claim it. In response he had gathered an army and, with the approval
of Innocent and of Philip Augustus, had crossed the Alps for the purpose
of winning over the German people from Otto to himself. The
battle of Bouvines (in which Frederick was not engaged, but from which
he profited immensely) was the death-blow to Otto's cause and Frederick
was soon recognized universally as head of the Empire.</p>

<p>The reign of Frederick II. (1212-1250) was a period of large importance
in European history. The Emperor's efforts and achievements&mdash;his
crusade, his great quarrel with Gregory IX. and Innocent IV., his legislation,
his struggles with the Lombard League&mdash;were full of interest and
significance, but, after all, not more so than the purely personal aspects
of his career. Mr. Bryce has a passage which states admirably the position
of Frederick with reference to his age and its problems. A portion
of it is as follows: "Out of the long array of the Germanic successors of
Charles [Charlemagne], he is, with Otto III.,<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> the only one who comes
before us with a genius and a frame of character that are not those of a
Northern or a Teuton. There dwelt in him, it is true, all the energy
and knightly valor of his father Henry and his grandfather Frederick I.
But along with these, and changing their direction, were other gifts,
inherited perhaps from his half Norman, half Italian mother and fostered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
by his education in Sicily, where Mussulman and Byzantine influences
were still potent, a love of luxury and beauty, an intellect refined,
subtle, philosophical. Through the mist of calumny and legend
it is but dimly that the truth of the man can be discerned, and the outlines
that appear serve to quicken rather than appease the curiosity
with which we regard one of the most extraordinary personages in history.
A sensualist, yet also a warrior and a politician; a profound law-giver
and an impassioned poet; in his youth fired by crusading fervor,
in later life persecuting heretics while himself accused of blasphemy and
unbelief; of winning manners and ardently beloved by his followers, but
with the stain of more than one cruel deed upon his name, he was the
marvel of his own generation, and succeeding ages looked back with
awe, not unmingled with pity, upon the inscrutable figure of the last
emperor who had braved all the terrors of the Church and died beneath
her ban, the last who had ruled from the sands of the ocean to the shores
of the Ionian Sea. But while they pitied they condemned. The undying
hatred of the papacy threw round his memory a lurid light; him
and him alone of all the imperial line, Dante, the worshipper of the
empire, must perforce deliver to the flames of hell."<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>The following selections from the <i>Greater Chronicle</i> of Matthew
Paris comprise some of the stories which were current in Frederick's
day regarding his manners, ideas, and deeds. Frederick was far ahead
of his age and it was inevitable that the qualities in him which men could
not understand or appreciate should become the grounds for dark
rumors and unsavory suspicions. Matthew Paris was an English monk
of St. Albans. It is thought that he was called <i>Parisiensis</i>, "the
Parisian," because of having been born or educated in the capital of
France. He seems to have confined his attention wholly to the study of
history, and mainly to the history of his own country. His <i>Chronicle</i>
takes up the story of English and continental affairs in detail with the
year 1235 (where Roger of Wendover had stopped in his <i>Flowers of
History</i>) and continues to the year 1259. His book has been described as
"probably the most generally useful historical production of the thirteenth
century."<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>In the course of the same year [1238] the fame of the Emperor
Frederick was clouded and marred by his jealous enemies and
rivals; for it was imputed to him that he was wavering in the
Catholic faith, or wandering from the right way, and had given
<span class="sidebar">Frederick
suspected
of heresy</span>
utterance to some speeches, from which it could
be inferred and suspected that he was not only
weak in the Catholic faith, but&mdash;what was a
much greater and more serious crime&mdash;that there was in him an
enormity of heresy, and the most dreadful blasphemy, to be detested
and execrated by all Christians. For it was reported that
the Emperor Frederick had said (although it may not be proper
to mention it) that three imposters had so craftily deceived their
contemporaries as to gain for themselves the mastery of the
world: these were Moses, Jesus, and Mahomet [Mohammed]; and
that he had impiously given expression to some wicked and incredible
ravings and blasphemies respecting the most holy
Eucharist. Far be it from any discreet man, much less a Christian,
to employ his tongue in such raving blasphemy. It was
also said by his rivals that the Emperor agreed with and believed in
the law of Mahomet more than that of Jesus Christ. A rumor
<span class="sidebar">Accusation
of friendly relations
with
the Saracens</span>
also crept amongst the people (which God forbid
to be true of such a great prince) that he had
been for a long time past in alliance with the
Saracens, and was more friendly to them than to the Christians;
and his rivals, who were endeavoring to blacken his fame, attempted
to establish this by many proofs. Whether they sinned
or not, He alone knows who is ignorant of nothing....</p>

<p>In Lent, of the same year [1239], seeing the rash proceedings
of the Emperor, and that his words pleaded excuse for his
sins,&mdash;namely, that by the assistance of some of the nobles
and judges of Sardinia he had taken into his own possession,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
and still held, the land and castles of the bishop of Sardinia, and
constantly declared that they were a portion of the Empire, and
<span class="sidebar">Frederick's
seizure of the
lands belonging
to a bishop</span>
that he by his first and chief oath would preserve
the rights of the Empire to the utmost of his
power, and would also collect the scattered portions
of it,&mdash;the Pope<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> was excited to the most
violent anger against him. He set forth some very serious complaints
and claims against the Emperor and wrote often boldly and
carefully to him, advising him repeatedly by many special messengers,
whose authority ought to have obtained from him the
greatest attention, to restore the possessions he had seized, and to
desist from depriving the Church of her possessions, of which she
was endowed by long prescription. And, like a skilful physician,
who at one time makes use of medicines, at another of the knife,
and at another of the cauterizing instrument, he mixed threats
with entreaties, friendly messages with fearful denunciations.
As the Emperor, however, scornfully rejected his requests, and
<span class="sidebar">Refusing to restore
them, he
is excommunicated</span>
excused his actions by arguments founded on
reason, his holiness the Pope, on Palm Sunday,
in the presence of a great many of the cardinals,
in the spirit of glowing anger, solemnly excommunicated the
said Emperor Frederick, as though he would at once have hurled
him from his imperial dignity, consigning him with terrible
denunciations to the possession of Satan at his death; and, as it
were, thundering forth the fury of his anger, he excited terror in
all his hearers....<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor, on hearing of this, was inflamed with violent
anger, and with oft-repeated reproaches accused the Church and
its rulers of ingratitude to him, and of returning evil for good.
He recalled to their recollection how he had exposed himself and
his property to the billows and to a thousand kinds of danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
for the advancement of the Church's welfare and the increase of
the Catholic faith, and affirmed that whatever honors the Church
possessed in the Holy Land had been acquired by his toil and
<span class="sidebar">Frederick accuses
the Pope
of ingratitude
and jealousy</span>
industry. "But," said he, "the Pope, jealous at
such a happy increase being acquired for the
Church by a layman, and who desires gold and
silver rather than an increase of the faith (as witness his proceedings),
and who extorts money from all Christendom in the name
of tithes, has, by all the means in his power, done his best to
supplant me, and has endeavored to disinherit me while fighting
for God, exposing my body to the weapons of war, to sickness,
and to the snares of his enemies, after encountering the dangers
of the unsparing billows. See what sort of protection is this of
our father's! What kind of assistance in difficulties is this
afforded by the vicar of Jesus Christ"!...<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>"Besides, he is united by a detestable alliance with the Saracens,&mdash;has
ofttimes sent messages and presents to them, and
in turn received the same from them with respect and alacrity...;
and what is a more execrable offense, he, when formerly
in the country beyond sea, made a kind of arrangement, or rather
collusion, with the sultan, and allowed the name of Mahomet
to be publicly proclaimed in the temple of the Lord day and
<span class="sidebar">Further accusation
of an
alliance with
the Saracens</span>
night; and lately, in the case of the sultan of Babylon
[Cairo], who, by his own hands, and through his
agents, had done irreparable mischief and injury
to the Holy Land and its Christian inhabitants, he caused that
sultan's ambassadors, in compliment to their master, as is reported,
to be honorably received and nobly entertained in his
kingdom of Sicily. He also, in opposition to the Christians,
abuses the pernicious and horrid rites of other infidels, and, entering
into an alliance of friendship with those who wickedly
pay little respect to and despise the Apostolic See, and have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
seceded from the unity of the Church, he, laying aside all respect
for the Christian religion, caused, as is positively asserted, the
duke of Bavaria, of illustrious memory, a special and devoted
ally of the Roman Church, to be murdered by the assassins. He
has also given his daughter in marriage to Battacius, an enemy
of God and the Church, who, together with his aiders, counsellors,
and abettors, was solemnly expelled from the communion
of the Christians by sentence of excommunication. Rejecting
the proceedings and customs of Catholic princes, neglecting
his own salvation and the purity of his fame, he does not employ
<span class="sidebar">His neglect of
pious and charitable
works</span>
himself in works of piety; and what is more (to
be silent on his wicked and dissolute practices),
although he has learned to practice oppression to
such a degree, he does not trouble himself to relieve those oppressed
by injuries, by extending his hand, as a Christian prince
ought, to bestow alms, although he has been eagerly aiming at
the destruction of the churches, and has crushed religious men
and other ecclesiastical persons with the burden and persecution
of his yoke. And it is not known that he ever built or founded
either churches, monasteries, hospitals, or other pious places.
Now these are not light, but convincing, grounds for suspicions
of heresy being entertained against him."...</p>

<p>When the Emperor Frederick was made fully aware of all
these proceedings [i.e., his excommunication at Lyons] he could
not contain himself, but burst into a violent rage and, darting a
scowling look on those who sat around him, he thundered forth:
"The Pope in his synod has disgraced me by depriving me of
my crown. Whence arises such great audacity? Whence proceeds
such rash presumption? Where are my chests which
<span class="sidebar">Frederick's
wrath at his
excommunication</span>
contain my treasures?" And on their being
brought and unlocked before him, by his order,
he said, "See if my crowns are lost now;" then
finding one, he placed it on his head and, being thus crowned,
he stood up, and, with threatening eyes and a dreadful voice, unrestrainable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
from passion, he said aloud, "I have not yet lost my
crown, nor will I be deprived of it by any attacks of the Pope
or the council, without a bloody struggle. Does his vulgar pride
raise him to such heights as to enable him to hurl from the
imperial dignity me, the chief prince of the world, than whom
none is greater&mdash;yea, who am without an equal? In this matter
my condition is made better: in some things I <i>was</i> bound to
obey, at least to respect, him; but now I am released from all
ties of affection and veneration, and also from the obligation of
any kind of peace with him." From that time forth, therefore,
he, in order to injure the Pope more effectually and perseveringly,
did all kinds of harm to his Holiness, in his money, as well as in
his friends and relatives.</p>

<h4>72. The Golden Bull of Charles IV. (1356)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The century following the death of Frederick II. (1250) was a period
of unrest and turbulence in German history, the net result of which
politically was the almost complete triumph of the princes, lay and clerical,
over the imperial power. By 1350 the local magnates had come to
be virtually sovereign throughout their own territories. They enjoyed
the right of legislation and the privileges of coining money and levying
taxes, and in many cases they had scarcely so much as a feudal bond to
remind them of their theoretical allegiance to the Empire. The one principle
of action upon which they could agree was that the central monarchy
should be kept permanently in the state of helplessness to which
it had been reduced. The power of choosing a successor when a vacancy
arose in the imperial office had fallen gradually into the hands of seven
men, who were known as the "electors" and who were recognized in the
fourteenth century as possessing collective importance far greater than
that of the emperor. Three of these seven&mdash;the archbishops of Mainz,
Trier, and Cologne&mdash;were great ecclesiastics; the other four&mdash;the king
of Bohemia, the margrave of Brandenburg, the duke of Saxony, and the
count palatine of the Rhine&mdash;were equally influential laymen. This
electoral college first came into prominence at the election of Rudolph I.
(of the House of Hapsburg) at the end of the Interregnum in 1273.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
From that time until the termination of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806
these seven men (eight after 1648 and nine after 1692) played a part in
German history not inferior to that of the emperors. They imposed
upon their candidates such conditions as they chose, and when the bearer
of the imperial title grew restive and difficult to control they did not
hesitate to make war upon him, or even in extreme cases to depose him.
It has been well said that never in all history have worse scandals been
connected with any sort of elections than were associated repeatedly
with the actions of these German electors.</p>

<p>The central document in German constitutional history in the Middle
Ages is the Golden Bull of Emperor Charles IV. (1347-1378), promulgated
in 1356. For a century prior to the reign of Charles the question of the
imperial succession had been one of extreme perplexity. The electoral
college had grown up to assume the responsibility, but this body rested
on no solid legal basis and its acts were usually regarded as null by all
whom they displeased, with the result that a civil war succeeded pretty
nearly every election. Charles was shrewd enough to see that the existing
system could not be set aside; the electors were entirely too powerful
to permit of that. But he also saw that it might at least be improved
by giving it the quality of legality which it had hitherto lacked.
The result of his efforts in this direction was the Golden Bull, issued and
confirmed at the diets of Nürnberg (Nuremberg) and Metz in 1356.
The document, thenceforth regarded as the fundamental law of the
Empire, dealt with a wide variety of subjects. It confirmed the electorship
in the person of the king of Bohemia which had long been disputed
by a rival branch of the family;<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> it made elaborate provision for the election
of the emperor by the seven magnates; it defined the social and
political prerogatives of these men and prescribed the relations which
they should bear to their subjects, to other princes, and to the emperor;
and it made numerous regulations regarding conspiracies, coinage, immunities,
the forfeiture of fiefs, the succession of electoral princes, etc.
In a word, as Mr. Bryce has put it, the document "confessed and legalized
the independence of the Electors and the powerlessness of the
crown."<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Only a few selections from it can be given here, particularly
those bearing on the methods of electing the emperor.</p>

<p>I. <b>1.</b> We decree and determine by this imperial edict that,
whenever the electoral princes are summoned according to the
ancient and praiseworthy custom to meet and elect a king of
the Romans and future emperor, each one of them shall be bound
<span class="sidebar">Guarantee
of safety of
travel for the
electors</span>
to furnish on demand an escort and safe-conduct
to his fellow electors or their representatives,
within his own lands and as much farther as he
can, for the journey to and from the city where the election is
to be held. Any electoral prince who refuses to furnish escort
and safe-conduct shall be liable to the penalties for perjury and
to the loss of his electoral vote for that occasion.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> We decree and command also that all other princes who
hold fiefs from the Empire, by whatever title, and all counts,
barons, knights, clients, nobles, commoners, citizens, and all
corporations of towns, cities, and territories of the Empire, shall
furnish escort and safe-conduct for this occasion to every electoral
prince or his representatives, on demand, within their own
lands and as much farther as they can. Violators of this decree
shall be punished as follows: princes, counts, barons, knights,
<span class="sidebar">Penalties for
violation of the
safe-conduct of
the electors</span>
clients, and all others of noble rank, shall suffer
the penalties of perjury, and shall lose the fiefs
which they hold of the emperor or any other lord,
and all their possessions; citizens and corporations shall also
suffer the penalty for perjury, shall be deprived of all the rights,
liberties, privileges, and graces which they have received from
the Empire, and shall incur the ban of the Empire against their
persons and property. Those whom we deprive of their rights
for this offense may be attacked by any man without appealing
to a magistrate, and without danger of reprisal; for they are rebels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
against the state and the Empire, and have attacked the honor
and security of the prince, and are convicted of faithlessness and

<span class="sidebar">Supplies for
the use of the
electors</span>
representatives on demand at the regular price and
without fraud, whenever they arrive at, or depart
from, the city on their way to or from the election.
Those who violate this decree shall suffer the penalties
described in the preceding paragraph for citizens and corporations.
If any prince, count, baron, knight, client, noble, commoner,
citizen, or city shall attack or molest in person or goods
any of the electoral princes or their representatives, on their way
to or from an election, whether they have safe-conduct or not,
he and his accomplices shall incur the penalties above described,
according to his position and rank.</p>

has been received at Mainz, within one month from the date of
<span class="sidebar">The electors

by the
archbishop
of Mainz</span>
receiving it the archbishop of Mainz shall send
notices of the death and the approaching election
to all the electoral princes. But if the archbishop
neglects or refuses to send such notices,
the electoral princes are commanded on their fidelity to assemble
on their own motion and without summons at the city
of Frankfort,<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> within three months from the death of the emperor,
for the purpose of electing a king of the Romans and
future emperor.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Each electoral prince or his representatives may bring
with him to Frankfort at the time of the election a retinue of
200 horsemen, of whom not more than 50 shall be armed.

withdraws from the place of the election
before the election has been completed, without

Roman Empire, that with the aid of God, and
according to my best judgment and knowledge,
I will cast my vote, in this election of the king of the Romans

the above oath, after that they shall live upon bread and water
and shall not leave the city until the election has been decided.</p>

<p>III. <b>1.</b> To prevent any dispute arising between the archbishops
of Trier, Mainz, and Cologne, electoral princes of the

Empire, as to their priority and rank in the diet,<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> it has been decided
and is hereby decreed, with the advice and consent of all
the electoral princes, ecclesiastical and secular, that the archbishop
of Trier shall have the seat directly opposite and facing the
<span class="sidebar">Order of precedence
of the
three archbishops</span>
emperor; that the archbishop of Mainz shall have
the seat at the right of the emperor when the diet
is held in the diocese or province of Mainz, or
anywhere in Germany except in the diocese of Cologne; that the
archbishop of Cologne shall have the seat at the right of the
emperor when the diet is held in the diocese or province of
Cologne, or anywhere in Gaul or Italy. This applies to all public
ceremonies&mdash;court sessions, conferring of fiefs, banquets, councils,
and all occasions on which the princes meet with the emperor
for the transaction of imperial business. This order of
seating shall be observed by the successors of the present archbishops
of Cologne, Trier, and Mainz, and shall never be questioned.</p>

<p>IV. <b>1.</b> In the imperial diet, at the council-board, table, and
all other places where the emperor or king of the Romans meets
with the electoral princes, the seats shall be arranged as follows:
<span class="sidebar">Seating
arrangement
at table</span>
On the right of the emperor, first, the archbishop
of Mainz, or of Cologne, according to the province
in which the meeting is held, as arranged above;
second, the king of Bohemia, because he is a crowned and
anointed prince; third, the count palatine of the Rhine; on the
left of the emperor, first, the archbishop of Cologne, or of Mainz;
second, the duke of Saxony; third, the margrave of Brandenburg.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> When the imperial throne becomes vacant, the archbishop
of Mainz shall have the authority, which he has had from of old,
to call the other electors together for the election. It shall be
his peculiar right also, when the electors have convened for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
election, to collect the votes, asking each of the electors separately
in the following order: first, the archbishop of Trier, who
shall have the right to the first vote, as he has had from of old;
<span class="sidebar">The order
of voting</span>
then the archbishop of Cologne, who has the office
of first placing the crown upon the head of the
king of the Romans; then the king of Bohemia, who has the priority
among the secular princes because of his royal title; fourth,
the count palatine of the Rhine; fifth, the duke of Saxony;
sixth, the margrave of Brandenburg. Then the princes shall ask
the archbishop of Mainz in turn to declare his choice and vote.
At the diet, the margrave of Brandenburg shall offer water to
the emperor or king, to wash his hands; the king of Bohemia
shall have the right to offer him the cup first, although, by reason
of his royal dignity, he shall not be bound to do this unless
he desires; the count palatine of the Rhine shall offer him food;
and the duke of Saxony shall act as his marshal in the accustomed
manner.</p>

<p>XI. <b>1.</b> We decree also that no count, baron, noble, vassal,

condition, or rank, shall be cited, haled, or summoned to any
authority before any tribunal outside of the territories, boundaries,

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
THE HUNDRED YEARS' WAR</h3>

<p>Our chief contemporary source of information on the history of the
Hundred Years' War is Jean Froissart's <i>Chronicles of England, France,
and the Adjoining Countries, from the Latter Part of the Reign of Edward II.
to the Coronation of Henry IV.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> and it is from this important work that
all of the extracts (except texts of treaties) which are included in this
chapter have been selected. Froissart was a French poet and historian,
born at Beaumont, near Valenciennes in Hainault, in 1337, when the
Hundred Years' War was just beginning. He lived until the early part
of the fifteenth century, 1410 being one of the conjectural dates of his
death. He was a man of keen mental faculties and had enjoyed the advantages
of an unusually thorough education during boyhood. This
native ability and training, together with his active public life and admirable
opportunities for observation, constituted his special qualification
for the writing of a history of his times. Froissart represents a type of
mediæval chronicler which was quite rare, in that he was not a monk
living in seclusion but a practical man of affairs, accustomed to travel
and intercourse with leading men in all the important countries of western
Europe. He lived for five years at the English court as clerk of the
Queen's Chamber; many times he was sent by the French king on diplomatic
missions to Scotland, Italy, and other countries; and he made
several private trips to various parts of Europe for the sole purpose of
acquiring information. Always and everywhere he was observant and
quick to take advantage of opportunities to ascertain facts which he
could use, and we are told that after it came to be generally known that he
was preparing to write an extended history of his times not a few kings
and princes took pains to send him details regarding events which they
desired to have recorded. The writing of the <i>Chronicles</i> was a life work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
When only twenty years of age Froissart submitted to Isabella, wife of
King Edward III. of England, an account of the battle of Poitiers, in
which the queen's son, the famous Black Prince, had won distinction in
the previous year. Thereafter the larger history was published book by
book, until by 1373 it was complete to date. Subsequently it was extended
to the year 1400 (it had begun with the events of 1326), while
the earlier portions were rewritten and considerably revised. And, in
deed, when death came to the author he was still working at his arduous
but congenial task. "As long as I live," he wrote upon one occasion,
"by the grace of God I shall continue it; for the more I follow it and
labor thereon, the more it pleases me. Even as a gentle knight or esquire
who loves arms, while persevering and continuing develops himself
therein, thus do I, laboring and striving with this matter, improve
and delight myself."</p>

<p>The <i>Chronicles</i> as they have come down to us are written in a lively
and pleasing style. It need hardly be said that they are not wholly
accurate; indeed, on the whole, they are quite inaccurate, measured even
by mediæval standards. Froissart was obliged to rely for a large portion
of his information upon older chronicles and especially upon conversations
and interviews with people in various parts of Europe. Such
sources are never wholly trustworthy and it must be admitted that our
author was not as careful to sift error from truth as he should have
been. His credulity betrayed him often into accepting what a little
investigation would have shown to be false, and only very rarely did he
make any attempt, as a modern historian would do, to increase and
verify his knowledge by a study of documents. Still, the <i>Chronicles</i>
constitute an invaluable history of the period they cover. The facts
they record, the events they explain, the vivid descriptions they contain,
and the side-lights they throw upon the life and manners of an
interesting age unite to give them a place of peculiar importance among
works of their kind. And, wholly aside from their historical value, they
constitute one of the monuments of mediæval French literature.</p>

<h4>73. An Occasion of War between the Kings of England and France</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The causes, general and specific, of the Hundred Years' War were
numerous. The most important were: (1) The long-standing bad feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
between the French and English regarding the possession of Normandy
and Guienne. England had lost the former to France and she had never
ceased to hope for its recovery; on the other hand, the French were
resolved upon the eventual conquest of the remaining English continental
possession of Guienne and were constantly asserting themselves
there in a fashion highly irritating to the English; (2) the assistance and
general encouragement given the rebellious Scots by the French; (3)
the pressure brought to bear upon the English crown by the popular
party in Flanders to claim the French throne and to resort to war to
obtain it. The Flemish wool trade was a very important item in England's
economic prosperity and it was felt to be essential at all hazards
to prevent the extension of French influence in Flanders, which would
inevitably mean the checking, if not the ruin, of the commercial relations
of the Flemish and the English; and (4) the claim to the throne of France
which Edward III., king of England, set up and prepared to defend. It
is this last occasion of war that Froissart describes in the passage below.</p>

<p>History tells us that Philip, king of France, surnamed the
Fair,<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> had three sons, besides his beautiful daughter Isabella,
married to the king of England.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> These three sons were very
handsome. The eldest, Louis, king of Navarre, during the lifetime
of his father, was called Louis Hutin; the second was named
Philip the Great, or the Long; and the third, Charles. All these
were kings of France, after their father Philip, by legitimate
succession, one after the other, without having by marriage any
male heirs.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Yet on the death of the last king, Charles, the
twelve peers and barons of France<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> did not give the kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
to Isabella, the sister, who was queen of England, because they
said and maintained, and still insist, that the kingdom of
<span class="sidebar">The succession
to the French
throne in 1328</span>
France is so noble that it ought not to go to a
woman; consequently neither to Isabella nor to
her son, the king of England; for they held that
the son of a woman cannot claim any right of succession where
that woman has none herself.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> For these reasons the twelve
peers and barons of France unanimously gave the kingdom of
France to the lord Philip of Valois, nephew of King Philip,<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> and
thus put aside the queen of England (who was sister to Charles,
the late king of France) and her son. Thus, as it seemed to
many people, the succession went out of the right line, which has
been the occasion of the most destructive wars and devastations
of countries, as well in France as elsewhere, as you will learn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
hereafter; the real object of this history being to relate the great
enterprises and deeds of arms achieved in these wars, for from
the time of good Charlemagne, king of France, never were such
feats performed.</p>

<h4>74. Edward III. Assumes the Arms and Title of the King of France</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Due to causes which have been mentioned, the relations of England
and France at the accession of Philip VI. in 1328 were so strained that
only a slight fanning of the flames was necessary to bring on an open
conflict. Edward III.'s persistent demand to be recognized as king of
France sufficed to accomplish this result. The war did not come at once,
for neither king felt himself ready for it; but it was inevitable and preparations
for it were steadily pushed on both sides from 1328 until its formal
declaration by Edward nine years later. These preparations were
not merely military and naval but also diplomatic. The primary object
of both sovereigns was to secure as many and as strong foreign alliances
as possible. In pursuit of this policy Philip soon assured himself of the
support of Louis de Nevers, count of Flanders, King John of Bohemia,
Alphonso XI. of Castile, and a number of lesser princes of the north.
Edward was even more successful. In Spain and the Scandinavian
countries many local powers allied themselves with him; in the Low
Countries, especially Flanders and Brabant, the people and the princes
chose generally to identify themselves with his cause; and the climax
came in July, 1337, when a treaty of alliance was concluded with the Emperor,
Louis of Bavaria. War was begun in this same year, and in 1338
Edward went himself to the continent to undertake a direct attack on
France from Flanders as a base. The years 1338 and 1339 were consumed
with ineffective operations against the walled cities of the French
frontier, Philip steadily refusing to be drawn into an open battle such
as Edward desired. The following year the English king resolved to
declare himself sovereign of France. The circumstances attending this
important step are detailed in the passage from Froissart given below.</p>

<p>Heretofore Edward had merely protested that by reason of his being a
grandson of Philip the Fair he should have been awarded the throne by
the French barons in 1328; now, at the instigation of his German and
Flemish allies, he flatly announces that he <i>is</i> of right the king and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
that Philip VI. is to be deposed as an usurper. Of course this was a declaration
which Edward could make good only by victory in the war upon
which he had entered. But the claim thus set up rendered it inevitable
that the war should be waged to the bitter end on both sides.</p>
</div>

edition), Chap. XXXI. Translated in Thomas Johnes, <i>Froissart's
Chronicles</i>, Vol. I., pp. 110-112.</p>

<p>When King Edward had departed from Flanders and arrived
at Brabant he set out straight for Brussels, whither he was attended
by the duke of Gueldres, the duke of Juliers, the marquis
of Blanckenburg, the earl of Mons, the lord John of Hainault, the
<span class="sidebar">The conference
at Brussels</span>
lord of Fauquemont, and all the barons of the
Empire who were allied to him, as they wished
to consider what was next to be done in this war which they had
begun. For greater expedition, they ordered a conference to be
held in the city of Brussels, and invited James van Arteveld<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> to
attend it, who came thither in great array, and brought with
him all the councils from the principal towns of Flanders.</p>

<p>At this parliament the king of England was advised by his
allies of the Empire to solicit the Flemings to give him their aid
and assistance in this war, to challenge the king of France, and
to follow King Edward wherever he should lead them, and in
return he would assist them in the recovery of Lisle, Douay, and
Bethune.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> The Flemings heard this proposal with pleasure;
but they requested of the king that they might consider it among
themselves and in a short time they would give their answer.</p>

<p>The king consented and soon after they made this reply:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
"Beloved sire, you formerly made us a similar request; and we
are willing to do everything in reason for you without prejudice
to our honor and faith. But we are pledged by promise on oath,
under a penalty of two millions of florins, to the apostolical
<span class="sidebar">Proposition
made by the
Flemings to
King Edward</span>
chamber,<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> not to act offensively against the king
of France in any way, whoever he may be, without
forfeiting this sum, and incurring the sentence
of excommunication. But if you will do what we will tell you,
you will find a remedy, which is, that you take the arms of
France, quarter them with those of England, and call yourself
king of France. We will acknowledge your title as good, and
we will demand of you quittance for the above sum, which you
will grant us as king of France. Thus we shall be absolved and
at liberty to go with you wherever it pleases you."</p>

<p>The king summoned his council, for he was loath to take the
title and arms of France, seeing that at present he had not conquered
any part of that kingdom and that it was uncertain whether
he ever should. On the other hand, he was unwilling to lose the
aid and assistance of the Flemings, who could be of greater
service to him than any others at that period. He consulted,
therefore, with the lords of the Empire, the lord Robert d'Artois,<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>
and his most privy councilors, who, after having duly weighed
the good and bad, advised him to make for answer to the Flemings,
<span class="sidebar">The agreement
concluded</span>
that if they would bind themselves under
their seals, to an agreement to aid him in carrying
on the war, he would willingly comply with their conditions,
and would swear to assist them in the recovery of Lisle, Douay,
and Bethune. To this they willingly consented. A day was
fixed for them to meet at Ghent,<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> where the king and the greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
part of the lords of the Empire, and in general the councils from
the different towns in Flanders, assembled. The above-mentioned
proposals and answers were then repeated, sworn to, and
sealed; and the king of England bore the arms of France, quartering
them with those of England. He also took the title of
king of France from that day forward.</p>

<h4>75. The Naval Battle of Sluys (1340)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In the spring of 1340 Edward returned to England to secure money
and supplies with which to prosecute the war. The French king thought
he saw in this temporary withdrawal of his enemy an opportunity to
strike him a deadly blow. A fleet of nearly two hundred vessels was
gathered in the harbor of Sluys, on the Flemish coast, with a view to
attacking the English king on his return to the continent and preventing
him from again securing a foothold in Flanders. Edward, however,
accepted the situation and made ready to fight his way back to the country
of his allies. June 24, 1340, he boldly attacked the French at Sluys.
The sharp conflict which ensued resulted in a brilliant victory for the
English. Philip's fleet found itself shut up in the harbor and utterly
unable to withstand the showers of arrows shot by the thousands of
archers who crowded the English ships. The French navy was annihilated,
England was relieved from the fear of invasion, and the whole
French coast was laid open to attack.</p>
</div>

<p class="source">Source&mdash;<i>Chroniques de Jean Froissart</i> (Société de l'Histoire de France
edition), Chap. XXXVII. Translated in Thomas Johnes, <i>Froissart's
Chronicles</i>, Vol. I., pp. 141-143.</p>

<p>He [King Edward] and his whole navy sailed from the Thames
the day before the eve of St. John the Baptist, 1340,<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> and made
straight for Sluys.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Quiriel, Sir Peter Bahucet, and Barbenoir, were at
that time lying between Blankenburg and Sluys with upwards
of one hundred and twenty large vessels, without counting
others. These were manned with about forty thousand men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
Genoese and Picards, including mariners. By the orders of the
king of France, they were there at anchor, awaiting the return
of the king of England, to dispute his passage.</p>

<p>When the king's fleet had almost reached Sluys, they saw so
many masts standing before it that they looked like a wood.
The king asked the commander of his ship what they could be.
The latter replied that he imagined they must be that armament
of Normans which the king of France kept at sea, and which
had so frequently done him much damage, had burned his good
<span class="sidebar">Edward determines
to fight
at Sluys</span>
town of Southampton and taken his large ship
the <i>Christopher</i>. The king replied, "I have for
a long time desired to meet them, and now,
please God and St. George, we will fight with them; for, in
truth, they have done me so much mischief that I will be revenged
on them if it be possible."</p>

<p>The king then drew up all his vessels, placing the strongest
in front, and his archers on the wings. Between every two
vessels with archers there was one of men-at-arms. He stationed
some detached vessels as a reserve, full of archers, to assist and
help such as might be damaged. There were in this fleet a great
many ladies from England, countesses, baronesses, and knights'
and gentlemen's wives, who were going to attend on the queen
at Ghent.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> These the king had guarded most carefully by three
hundred men-at-arms and five hundred archers.</p>

<p>When the king of England and his marshals had properly
divided the fleet, they hoisted their sails to have the wind on
their quarter, as the sun shone full in their faces (which they
considered might be of disadvantage to them) and stretched out
a little, so that at last they got the wind as they wished. The
Normans, who saw them tack, could not help wondering why they
<span class="sidebar">The French
make ready</span>
did so, and remarked that they took good care to
turn about because they were afraid of meddling
with them. They perceived, however, by his banner, that the king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
was on board, which gave them great joy, as they were eager to
fight with him. So they put their vessels in proper order, for
they were expert and gallant men on the seas. They filled the
<i>Christopher</i>, the large ship which they had taken the year before
from the English, with trumpets and other warlike instruments,
and ordered her to fall upon the English.</p>

<p>The battle then began very fiercely. Archers and cross-bowmen
shot with all their might at each other, and the men-at-arms
engaged hand to hand. In order to be more successful,
they had large grapnels and iron hooks with chains, which they
flung from ship to ship to moor them to each other. There were
many valiant deeds performed, many prisoners made, and many
rescues. The <i>Christopher</i>, which led the van, was recaptured
<span class="sidebar">The battle
rages</span>
by the English, and all in her taken or killed.
There were then great shouts and cries, and the
English manned her again with archers, and sent her to fight
against the Genoese.</p>

<p>This battle was very murderous and horrible. Combats at
sea are more destructive and obstinate than upon land, for it is
not possible to retreat or flee&mdash;every one must abide his fortune,
and exert his prowess and valor. Sir Hugh Quiriel and his companions
were bold and determined men; they had done much
mischief to the English at sea and destroyed many of their ships.
The combat, therefore, lasted from early in the morning until
noon,<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> and the English were hard pressed, for their enemies were
four to one, and the greater part men who had been used to the
sea.</p>

<p>The king, who was in the flower of his youth, showed himself
on that day a gallant knight, as did the earls of Derby, Pembroke,
Hereford, Huntingdon, Northampton, and Gloucester;
the lord Reginald Cobham, lord Felton, lord Bradestan, sir
Richard Stafford, the lord Percy, sir Walter Manny, sir Henry
de Flanders, sir John Beauchamp, sir John Chandos, the lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
Delaware, Lucie lord Malton, and the lord Robert d'Artois,
now called earl of Richmond. I cannot remember the names of
<span class="sidebar">The English
triumph</span>
all those who behaved so valiantly in the combat.
But they did so well that, with some assistance
from Bruges and those parts of the country, the French were
completely defeated, and all the Normans and the others were
killed or drowned, so that not one of them escaped.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>After the king had gained this victory, which was on the eve
of St. John's day,<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> he remained all that night on board his
ship before Sluys, and there were great noises with trumpets and
all kinds of other instruments.</p>

<h4>76. The Battle of Crécy (1346)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>In July, 1346, Edward III. landed on the northwest coast of Normandy
with a splendid army of English, Irish, and Welsh, including ten
thousand men skilled in the use of the long bow. He advanced eastward,
plundering and devastating as he went, probably with the ultimate intention
of besieging Calais. Finding the passage of the Seine impossible
at Rouen, he ascended the river until he came into the vicinity of Paris,
only to learn that Philip with an army twice the size of that of the English
had taken up a position on the Seine to turn back the invasion.
The French king allowed himself to be outwitted, however, and Edward
got out of the trap into which he had fallen by marching northward to
the village of Crécy in Ponthieu. With an army that had grown to outnumber
the English three to one Philip advanced in the path of the
enemy, first to Abbeville on the Somme, and later to Crécy, slightly to
the east of which Edward had taken his stand for battle. The English
arrived at Crécy about noon on Friday, August 25. The French were
nearly a day behind, having spent the night at Abbeville and set out
thence over the roads to Crécy before sunrise Saturday morning. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
army of the English numbered probably about 14,000, besides an uncertain
reserve of Welsh and Irish troops; that of the French numbered
about 70,000, including 15,000 Genoese cross-bowmen. The course of
the battle is well described by Froissart in the passage below. Doubtless
the account is not accurate in every particular, yet it must be correct
in the main and it shows very vividly the character of French and English
warfare in this period. Despite the superior numbers of the French,
the English had small difficulty in winning a decisive victory. This was
due to several things. In the first place, the French army was a typical
feudal levy and as such was sadly lacking in discipline and order, while
the English troops were under perfect control. In the next place, the
use of the long-bow gave the English infantry a great advantage over
the French knights, and even over the Genoese mercenaries, who could
shoot just once while an English long-bowman was shooting twelve times.
In the third place, Philip's troops were exhausted before entering the
battle and it was a grievous error on the part of the king to allow the
conflict to begin before his men had an opportunity for rest.<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The greatest
significance of the English victory lay in the blow it struck at feudalism,
and especially the feudal type of warfare. It showed very clearly
that the armored knight was no match for the common foot-soldier, armed
simply with his long-bow, and that feudal methods and ideals had come
to be inconsistent with success in war.</p>

edition), Chap. LX. Translated in Thomas Johnes, <i>Froissart's
Chronicles</i>, Vol. I., pp. 320-329 <i>passim</i>.</p>

<p>The king of England, as I have mentioned before, encamped
this Friday in the plain,<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> for he found the country abounding
in provisions; but if they should have failed, he had an abundance
in the carriages which attended him. The army set about furbishing
and repairing their armor; and the king gave a supper that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
evening to the earls and barons of his army, where they made
good cheer. On their taking leave, the king remained alone with
the lord of his bed-chamber. He retired into his oratory and,
falling on his knees before the altar, prayed to God, that if he
should fight his enemies on the morrow he might come off with
honor. About midnight he went to his bed and, rising early
the next day, he and the Prince of Wales<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> heard Mass and communicated.
The greater part of his army did the same, confessed,
and made proper preparations.</p>

<p>After Mass the king ordered his men to arm themselves and
assemble on the ground he had before fixed on. He had enclosed
<span class="sidebar">The English
prepare for
battle</span>
a large park near a wood, on the rear of
his army, in which he placed all his baggage-wagons
and horses; and this park had but one
entrance. His men-at-arms and archers remained on foot.
The king afterwards ordered, through his constable and his
two marshals, that the army should be divided into three
battalions....</p>

<p>The king then mounted a small palfrey, having a white wand
in his hand and, attended by his two marshals on each side of
him, he rode through all the ranks, encouraging and entreating
the army, that they should guard his honor. He spoke this so
gently, and with such a cheerful countenance, that all who had
been dejected were immediately comforted by seeing and hearing
him.</p>

<p>When he had thus visited all the battalions, it was near ten
o'clock. He retired to his own division and ordered them all to
eat heartily afterwards and drink a glass. They ate and drank at
their ease; and, having packed up pots, barrels, etc., in the carts,
they returned to their battalions, according to the marshals'
orders, and seated themselves on the ground, placing their
helmets and bows before them, that they might be the fresher
when their enemies should arrive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span></p>

<p>That same Saturday, the king of France arose betimes and
heard Mass in the monastery of St. Peter's in Abbeville,<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> where
he was lodged. Having ordered his army to do the same, he
left that town after sunrise. When he had marched about two
leagues from Abbeville and was approaching the enemy, he was
advised to form his army in order of battle, and to let those on
foot march forward, that they might not be trampled on by the
horses. The king, upon this, sent off four knights&mdash;the lord
<span class="sidebar">The French
advance from
Abbeville to
Crécy</span>
Moyne of Bastleberg, the lord of Noyers, the
lord of Beaujeu, and the lord of Aubigny&mdash;who
rode so near to the English that they could clearly
distinguish their position. The English plainly perceived that
they were come to reconnoitre. However, they took no notice
of it, but suffered them to return unmolested. When the king
of France saw them coming back, he halted his army, and the
knights, pushing through the crowds, came near the king, who
said to them, "My lords, what news?" They looked at each
other, without opening their mouths; for no one chose to speak
first. At last the king addressed himself to the lord Moyne,
who was attached to the king of Bohemia, and had performed
very many gallant deeds, so that he was esteemed one of the
most valiant knights in Christendom. The lord Moyne said,
"Sir, I will speak, since it pleases you to order me, but with the
assistance of my companions. We have advanced far enough
to reconnoitre your enemies. Know, then, that they are drawn
up in three battalions and are awaiting you. I would advise,
for my part (submitting, however, to better counsel), that you
halt your army here and quarter them for the night; for before
the rear shall come up and the army be properly drawn out, it
<span class="sidebar">Philip's
knights advise
delay</span>
will be very late. Your men will be tired and in
disorder, while they will find your enemies fresh
and properly arrayed. On the morrow, you may
draw up your army more at your ease and may reconnoitre at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
leisure on what part it will be most advantageous to begin the
attack; for, be assured, they will wait for you."</p>

<p>The king commanded that it should be so done; and the two
marshals rode, one towards the front, and the other to the rear,
crying out, "Halt banners, in the name of God and St. Denis."
Those that were in the front halted; but those behind said they
would not halt until they were as far forward as the front.
When the front perceived the rear pushing on, they pushed forward;
and neither the king nor the marshals could stop them,
<span class="sidebar">Confusion in
the French
ranks</span>
but they marched on without any order until
they came in sight of their enemies.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> As soon as
the foremost rank saw them, they fell back at
once in great disorder, which alarmed those in the rear, who
thought they had been fighting. There was then space and
room enough for them to have passed forward, had they been
willing to do so. Some did so, but others remained behind.</p>

<p>All the roads between Abbeville and Crécy were covered with
common people, who, when they had come within three leagues
of their enemies, drew their swords, crying out, "Kill, kill;" and
with them were many great lords who were eager to make show
of their courage. There is no man, unless he had been present,
who can imagine, or describe truly, the confusion of that day;
especially the bad management and disorder of the French,
whose troops were beyond number.</p>

<p>The English, who were drawn up in three divisions and seated
on the ground, on seeing their enemies advance, arose boldly
<span class="sidebar">The English
prepare for
battle</span>
and fell into their ranks. That of the prince<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
was the first to do so, whose archers were formed
in the manner of a portcullis, or harrow, and the
men-at-arms in the rear. The earls of Northampton and
Arundel, who commanded the second division, had posted themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
in good order on his wing to assist and succor the prince,
if necessary.</p>

<p>You must know that these kings, dukes, earls, barons, and
lords of France did not advance in any regular order, but one
after the other, or in any way most pleasing to themselves. As
soon as the king of France came in sight of the English his blood
began to boil, and he cried out to his marshals, "Order the
Genoese forward, and begin the battle, in the name of God and
St. Denis."</p>

<p>There were about fifteen thousand Genoese cross-bowmen; but
they were quite fatigued, having marched on foot that day six
leagues, completely armed, and with their cross-bows. They
told the constable that they were not in a fit condition to do any
great things that day in battle. The earl of Alençon, hearing this,
said, "This is what one gets by employing such scoundrels, who
fail when there is any need for them."</p>

<p>During this time a heavy rain fell, accompanied by thunder
and a very terrible eclipse of the sun; and before this rain a
great flight of crows hovered in the air over all those battalions,
making a loud noise. Shortly afterwards it cleared up and the
sun shone very brightly; but the Frenchmen had it in their faces,
and the English at their backs.</p>

<p>When the Genoese were somewhat in order they approached
the English and set up a loud shout in order to frighten them;
but the latter remained quite still and did not seem to hear it.
They then set up a second shout and advanced a little forward;
but the English did not move. They hooted a third time, advancing
with their cross-bows presented, and began to shoot.
The English archers then advanced one step forward and shot
their arrows with such force and quickness that it seemed as
if it snowed.</p>

<p>When the Genoese felt these arrows, which pierced their arms,
heads, and through their armor, some of them cut the strings
of their cross-bows, others flung them on the ground, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
turned about and retreated, quite discomfited. The French had
a large body of men-at-arms on horseback, richly dressed, to
<span class="sidebar">The Genoese
mercenaries
repulsed</span>
support the Genoese. The king of France, seeing
them thus fall back, cried out, "Kill me those
scoundrels; for they stop up our road, without
any reason." You would then have seen the above-mentioned
men-at-arms lay about them, killing all that they could of
these runaways.</p>

<p>The English continued shooting as vigorously and quickly as
before. Some of their arrows fell among the horsemen, who
were sumptuously equipped and, killing and wounding many,
made them caper and fall among the Genoese, so that they were
in such confusion they could never rally again. In the English
army there were some Cornish and Welshmen on foot who had
<span class="sidebar">Slaughter by
the Cornish
and Welsh</span>
armed themselves with large knives. These, advancing
through the ranks of the men-at-arms
and archers, who made way for them, came upon
the French when they were in this danger and, falling upon earls,
barons, knights and squires, slew many, at which the king of
England was afterwards much exasperated.</p>

<p>The valiant king of Bohemia was slain there. He was called
Charles of Luxemburg, for he was the son of the gallant king
and emperor, Henry of Luxemburg.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Having heard the order
of the battle, he inquired where his son, the lord Charles, was.
His attendants answered that they did not know, but believed
that he was fighting. The king said to them: "Sirs, you are
all my people, my friends and brethren at arms this day; therefore,
as I am blind, I request of you to lead me so far into the
engagement that I may strike one stroke with my sword." The
<span class="sidebar">Death of the
king of Bohemia</span>
knights replied that they would lead him forward
immediately; and, in order that they might
not lose him in the crowd, they fastened the reins
of all their horses together, and put the king at their head,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
that he might gratify his wish, and advanced towards the enemy.
The king rode in among the enemy, and made good use of his
sword; for he and his companions fought most gallantly. They
advanced so far that they were all slain; and on the morrow they
were found on the ground, with their horses all tied together.</p>

<p>Early in the day, some French, Germans, and Savoyards had
broken through the archers of the prince's battalion, and had
engaged with the men-at-arms, upon which the second battalion
came to his aid; and it was time, for otherwise he would
have been hard pressed. The first division, seeing the danger
they were in, sent a knight<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> in great haste to the king of England,
who was posted upon an eminence, near a windmill. On
the knight's arrival, he said, "Sir, the earl of Warwick, the
lord Stafford, the lord Reginald Cobham, and the others who are
about your son are vigorously attacked by the French; and they
entreat that you come to their assistance with your battalion
for, if the number of the French should increase, they fear he
will have too much to do."</p>

<p>The king replied: "Is my son dead, unhorsed, or so badly
wounded that he cannot support himself?" "Nothing of the
sort, thank God," rejoined the knight; "but he is in so hot an
engagement that he has great need of your help." The king
<span class="sidebar">Edward gives
the Black
Prince a chance
to win his spurs</span>
answered, "Now, Sir Thomas, return to those
who sent you and tell them from me not to send
again for me this day, or expect that I shall come,
let what will happen, as long as my son has life; and say that I
command them to let the boy win his spurs; for I am determined,
if it please God, that all the glory and honor of this day
shall be given to him, and to those into whose care I have entrusted
him." The knight returned to his lords and related the
king's answer, which greatly encouraged them and made them
regret that they had ever sent such a message.</p>

<p>Late after vespers, the king of France had not more about him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
than sixty men, every one included. Sir John of Hainault, who
was of the number, had once remounted the king; for the latter's
horse had been killed under him by an arrow. He said to the king,
"Sir, retreat while you have an opportunity, and do not expose
<span class="sidebar">King Philip
abandons the
field of battle</span>
yourself so needlessly. If you have lost this
battle, another time you will be the conqueror."
After he had said this, he took the bridle of the
king's horse and led him off by force; for he had before entreated
him to retire.</p>

<p>The king rode on until he came to the castle of La Broyes,
where he found the gates shut, for it was very dark. The king
ordered the governor of it to be summoned. He came upon the
battlements and asked who it was that called at such an hour.
The king answered, "Open, open, governor; it is the fortune of
France." The governor, hearing the king's voice, immediately
descended, opened the gate, and let down the bridge. The king
and his company entered the castle; but he had with him only
five barons&mdash;Sir John of Hainault, the lord Charles of Montmorency,
the lord of Beaujeu, the lord of Aubigny, and the lord
of Montfort. The king would not bury himself in such a place as
that, but, having taken some refreshments, set out again with
his attendants about midnight, and rode on, under the direction
of guides who were well acquainted with the country, until,
about daybreak, he came to Amiens, where he halted.</p>

<p>This Saturday the English never quitted their ranks in pursuit
of any one, but remained on the field, guarding their position
<span class="sidebar">The English
after the
battle</span>
and defending themselves against all who
attacked them. The battle was ended at the hour
of vespers. When, on this Saturday night, the
English heard no more hooting or shouting, nor any more crying
out to particular lords, or their banners, they looked upon the
field as their own and their enemies as beaten.</p>

<p>They made great fires and lighted torches because of the
darkness of the night. King Edward then came down from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
post, who all that day had not put on his helmet, and, with his
whole battalion, advanced to the Prince of Wales, whom he
embraced in his arms and kissed, and said, "Sweet son, God
give you good preference. You are my son, for most loyally have
you acquitted yourself this day. You are worthy to be a
sovereign." The prince bowed down very low and humbled
himself, giving all honor to the king his father.</p>

<p>The English, during the night, made frequent thanksgivings
to the Lord for the happy outcome of the day, and without
rioting; for the king had forbidden all riot or noise.</p>

<h4>77. The Sack of Limoges (1370)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>As a single illustration of the devastation wrought by the Hundred
Years' War, and of the barbarity of the commanders and troops engaged
in it, Froissart's well-known description of the sack of Limoges in 1370
by the army of the Black Prince is of no small interest. In some respects,
of course, circumstances in connection with this episode were exceptional,
and we are not to imagine that such heartless and indiscriminate massacres
were common. Yet the evidence which has survived all goes to
show that the long course of the war was filled with cruelty and destruction
in a measure almost inconceivable among civilized peoples in more
modern times.</p>
</div>

<p class="source">Source&mdash;<i>Chroniques de Jean Froissart</i> (Société de l'Histoire de France
edition), Chap. XCVII. Translated in Thomas Johnes, <i>Froissart's
Chronicles</i>, Vol. II., pp. 61-68 <i>passim</i>.</p>

<p>When word was brought to the prince that the city of Limoges<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>
had become French, that the bishop, who had been his companion
and one in whom he had formerly placed great confidence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
was a party to all the treaties and had greatly aided and
assisted in the surrender, he was in a violent passion and held
<span class="sidebar">The Black
Prince resolves
to retake
Limoges</span>
the bishop and all other churchmen in very low
estimation, in whom formerly he had put great
trust. He swore by the soul of his father, which
he had never perjured, that he would have it back again, that
he would not attend to anything before he had done this, and
that he would make the inhabitants pay dearly for their treachery....<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>All these men-at-arms were drawn out in battle-array and took
the field, when the whole country began to tremble for the
consequences. At that time the Prince of Wales was not able
to mount his horse, but was, for his greater ease, carried in a
litter. They followed the road to the Limousin,<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> in order to get
to Limoges, where in due time they arrived and encamped all
around it. The prince swore he would never leave the place
until he had regained it.</p>

<p>The bishop of the place and the inhabitants found that they
had acted wickedly and had greatly incensed the prince, for which
they were very repentant, but that was now of no avail, as they
were not the masters of the town.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> When the prince and his
marshals had well considered the strength and force of Limoges,
and knew the number of people that were in it, they agreed that
<span class="sidebar">The town to
be undermined</span>
they could never take it by assault, but said they
would attempt it by another manner. The prince
was always accustomed to carry with him on his expeditions a
large body of miners. These were immediately set to work and
made great progress. The knights who were in the town soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
perceived that they were undermining them, and on that account
began to countermine to prevent the effect....</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales remained about a month, and not more,
before the city of Limoges. He would not allow any assaults or
skirmishing, but kept his miners steadily at work. The knights
in the town perceived what they were about and made countermines
to destroy them, but they failed in their attempt. When
the miners of the prince (who, as they found themselves countermined,
kept changing the line of direction of their own mine)
had finished their business, they came to the prince and said,
"My lord, we are ready, and will throw down, whenever it pleases
you, a very large part of the wall into the ditch, through the
breach of which you may enter the town at your ease and without
danger."</p>

<p>This news was very agreeable to the prince, who replied: "I
desire, then, that you prove your words to-morrow morning at
six o'clock." The miners set fire to the combustibles in the
mine, and on the morrow morning, as they had foretold the
<span class="sidebar">The English
assault</span>
prince, they flung down a great piece of wall which
filled the ditches. The English saw this with
pleasure, for they were armed and prepared to enter the town.
Those on foot did so and ran to the gate, which they destroyed,
as well as the barriers, for there were no other defenses; and all
this was done so suddenly that the inhabitants had not time to
prevent it.</p>

<p>The prince, the duke of Lancaster, the earls of Cambridge and
of Pembroke, sir Guiscard d'Angle and the others, with their
men, rushed into the town. You would then have seen pillagers,
active to do mischief, running through the town, slaying men,
women, and children, according to their orders. It was a most
melancholy business; for all ranks, ages, and sexes cast themselves
on their knees before the prince, begging for mercy; but
he was so inflamed with passion and revenge that he listened
to none. But all were put to the sword, wherever they could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
be found, even those who were not guilty. For I know not
<span class="sidebar">Barbarity of
the sack</span>
why the poor were not spared, who could not have had any
part in the treason; but they suffered for it, and
indeed more than those who had been the leaders
of the treachery.</p>

<p>There was not that day in the city of Limoges any heart so
hardened, or that had any sense of religion, that did not deeply
bewail the unfortunate events passing before men's eyes; for
upwards of three thousand men, women, and children were put to
death that day. God have mercy on their souls, for they were
truly martyrs.... The entire town was pillaged, burned,
and totally destroyed. The English then departed, carrying
with them their booty and prisoners.</p>

<h4>78. The Treaties of Bretigny (1360) and Troyes (1420)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The most important documents in the diplomatic history of the Hundred
Years' War are the texts of the treaty of London (1359), the treaty
of Bretigny (1360), the truce of Paris (1396), the treaty of Troyes (1420),
the treaty of Arras (1435), and the truce of Tours (1444). Brief extracts
from two of these are given below. The treaty of Bretigny was negotiated
soon after the refusal of the French to ratify the treaty of London.
In November, 1359, King Edward III., with his son, Edward, the Black
Prince, and the duke of Lancaster, crossed the Channel, marched on
Rheims, and threatened Paris. Negotiations for a new peace were actively
opened in April, 1360, after the English had established themselves
at Montlhéri, south from Paris. The French king, John II., who had
been taken prisoner at Poitiers (1356), gave full powers of negotiation
to his son Charles, duke of Normandy and regent of the kingdom. For
some time no definite conclusions were reached, owing chiefly to Edward's
unwillingness to renounce his claim to the French throne. Late
in April the negotiations were transferred to Chartres, subsequently to
Bretigny. Finally, on the eighth of May, representatives of the two parties
signed the so-called treaty of Bretigny. Although the instrument
was promptly ratified by the French regent and by the Black Prince
(and, if we may believe Froissart, by the two kings themselves), it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
afterwards revised and accepted in a somewhat different form by the
monarchs and their following assembled at Calais (October 24, 1360).
The most important respect in which the second document differed from
the first was the omission of Article 12 of the first treaty, in which Edward
renounced his claim to the throne of France and the sovereignty of
Normandy, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, Brittany, and Flanders; nevertheless
Edward, at Calais, made this renunciation in a separate convention,
which for all practical purposes was regarded as a part of the treaty.
The passages printed below are taken from the Calais text. Most of the
thirty-nine articles composing the document are devoted to mere details.
The war was renewed after a few years, and within two decades
the English had lost all the territory guaranteed to them in 1360, except
a few coast towns.</p>

<p>The treaty of Troyes (1420) belongs to one of the most stormy periods
in all French history. The first two decades of the fifteenth century
were marked by a cessation of the war with England (until its renewal
in 1415), but also unfortunately by the outbreak of a desperate civil
struggle between two great factions of the French people, the Burgundians
and the Armagnacs. The Burgundians, led by Philip the Bold
and John the Fearless (successive dukes of Burgundy), stood for a policy
of friendship with England, while the Armagnacs, comprising the adherents
of Charles, duke of Orleans, whose wife was a daughter of the
count of Armagnac, advocated the continuation of the war with the
English; though, in reality, the forces which kept the two factions apart
were jealousy and ambition rather than any mere question of foreign
relations. The way was prepared for a temporary Burgundian triumph
by the notable victory of the English at Agincourt in 1415 and by the
assassination of John the Fearless at Paris in 1419, which made peace
impossible and drove the Burgundians openly into the arms of the English.
Philip the Good, the new duke of Burgundy, became the avowed
ally of the English king Henry V., who since 1417 had been slowly but
surely conquering Normandy and now had the larger portion of it in
his possession. Philip recognized Henry as the true heir to the French
throne and in 1419 concluded with him two distinct treaties on that
basis. Charles VI., the reigning king of France, was mentally unbalanced
and the queen, who bitterly hated the Armagnacs (with whom her son,
the Dauphin Charles, was actively identified), was easily persuaded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
Duke Philip to acquiesce in a treaty by which the succession should be
vested in the English king upon the death of Charles VI. The result
was the treaty of Troyes, signed May 21, 1420. According to agreements
already entered into by Philip and Henry, the latter was to marry
Catherine, daughter of Charles VI. (the marriage was not mentioned in
the treaty of Troyes, but it was clearly assumed), and he was to act as
regent of France until Charles VI.'s death and then become king in his
own name. Most of the thirty-one articles of the treaty were taken up
with a definition of Henry's position and obligations as regent and prospective
sovereign of France.</p>

<p>In due time the marriage of Henry and Catherine took place and
Henry assumed the regency, though the Armagnacs, led by the Dauphin,
refused absolutely to accept the settlement. War broke out, in the
course of which (in 1422) Henry V. died and was succeeded by his infant
son, Henry VI. In the same year Charles VI. also died, which
meant that the young Henry would become king of France. With such
a prospect the future of the country looked dark. Nevertheless, the
death of Charles VI. and of Henry V. came in reality as a double blessing.
Henry V. might long have kept the French in subjection and his
position as Charles VI.'s son-in-law gave him some real claim to rule in
France. But with the field cleared, as it was in 1422, opportunity was
given for the Dauphin Charles (Charles VII.) to retrieve the fallen fortunes
of his country&mdash;a task which, with more or less energy and skill,
he managed in the long run to accomplish.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE</h3>

<p>The question as to when the Middle Ages came to an end cannot be
answered with a specific date, or even with a particular century. The
transition from the mediæval world to the modern was gradual and was
accomplished at a much earlier period in some lines than in others.
Roughly speaking, the change fell within the two centuries and a half
from 1300 to 1550. This transitional epoch is commonly designated
the Age of the Renaissance, though if the term is taken in its most proper
sense as denoting the flowering of an old into a new culture it scarcely
does justice to the period, for political and religious developments in
these centuries were not less fundamental than the revival and fresh
stimulus of culture. But in the earlier portion of the period, particularly
the fourteenth century, the intellectual awakening was the most obvious
feature of the movement and, for the time being, the most important.</p>

<p>The renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was not the
first that Europe had known. There had been a notable revival of learning
in the time of Charlemagne&mdash;the so-called Carolingian renaissance;
another at the end of the tenth century, in the time of the Emperor
Otto III. and Pope Sylvester II.; and a third in the twelfth century,
with its center in northern France. The first two, however, had proved
quite transitory, and even the third and most promising had dried up
in the fruitless philosophy of the scholastics.</p>

<p>Before there could be a vital and permanent intellectual revival it was
indispensable that the mediæval attitude of mind undergo a fundamental
change. This attitude may be summed up in the one phrase,
the absolute dominance of "authority"&mdash;the authority, primarily, of
the Church, supplemented by the writings of a few ancients like Aristotle.
The scholars of the earlier Middle Ages busied themselves, not with
research and investigation whereby to increase knowledge, but rather
with commenting on the Scriptures, the writings of the Church fathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
and Aristotle, and drawing conclusions and inferences by reasoning from
these accepted authorities. There was no disposition to question what
was found in the books, or to supplement it with fresh information. Only
after about 1300 did human interests become sufficiently broadened to
make men no longer altogether content with the mere process of threshing
over the old straw. Gradually there began to appear scholars who
suggested the idea, novel for the day, that the books did not contain all
that was worth knowing, and also that perchance some things that had
long gone unquestioned just because they were in the books were not
true after all. In other words, they proposed to investigate things for
themselves and to apply the tests of observation and impartial reason.</p>

<p>The most influential factor in producing this change of attitude was
the revival of classical literature and learning. The Latin classics, and
even some of the Greek, had not been unknown in the earlier Middle
Ages, but they had not been read widely, and when read at all they had
been valued principally as models of rhetoric rather than as a living literature
to be enjoyed for the ideas that were contained in it and the
forms in which they were expressed. These ideas were, of course, generally
pagan, and that in itself was enough to cause the Church to look
askance at the use of classical writings, except for grammatical or antiquarian
purposes. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however,
due to a variety of causes, the reading of the classics became commoner
than since Roman days, and men, bringing to them more open minds,
were profoundly attracted by the fresh, original, human ideas of life and
the world with which Vergil and Horace and Cicero, for example, overflowed.
It was all a new discovery of the world and of man, and from the
<i>humanitas</i> which the scholars found set forth as the classical conception
of culture they themselves took the name of "humanists," while the subjects
of their studies came to be known as the <i>litteræ humaniores</i>. This
first great phase of the Renaissance&mdash;the birth of humanism&mdash;found
its finest expression in Dante and Petrarch, and it cannot be studied
with better effect than in certain of the writings of these two men.</p>

<h4>79. Dante's Defense of Italian as a Literary Language</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Dante Alighieri was born at Florence in 1265. Of his early life little
is known. His family seems to have been too obscure to have much part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
in the civil struggles with which Florence, and all Italy, in that day
were vexed. The love affair with Beatrice, whose story Boccaccio relates
with so much zest, is the one sharply-defined feature of Dante's
youth and early manhood. It is known that at the age of eighteen the
young Florentine was a poet and was winning wide recognition for his
sonnets. Much time was devoted by him to study of literature and the
arts, but the details of his employments, intellectual and otherwise, are
impossible to make out. In 1290 occurred the death of Beatrice, which
event marked an epoch in the poetical lover's life. In his sorrow he
took refuge in the study of such books as Boëthius's <i>Consolations of
Philosophy</i> and Cicero's <i>Friendship</i>, and became deeply interested in
literary, and especially philosophical, problems. In 1295 he entered
political life, taking from the outset a prominent part in the deliberations
of the Florentine General Council and the Council of Consuls of the Arts.
He assumed a firm attitude against all forms of lawlessness and in resistance
to any external interference in Florentine affairs. Owing to
conditions which he could not influence, however, his career in this
direction was soon cut short and most of the remainder of his life was
spent as a political exile, at Lucca, Verona, Ravenna, and other Italian
cities, with a possible visit to Paris. He died at Ravenna, September 14,
1321, in his fifty-seventh year.</p>

<p>Dante has well been called "the Janus-faced," because he stood at
the threshold of the new era and looked both forward and backward.
His <i>Divine Comedy</i> admirably sums up the mediæval spirit, and yet it
contains many suggestions of the coming age. His method was essentially
that of the scholastics, but he knew many of the classics and had
a genuine respect for them as literature. He was a mediævalist in his
attachment to the Holy Roman Empire, yet he cherished the purely
modern ambition of a united Italy. It is deeply significant that he
chose to write his great poem&mdash;one of the most splendid in the world's
literature&mdash;in the Italian tongue rather than the Latin. Aside from
the fact that this, more than anything else, caused the Tuscan dialect,
rather than the rival Venetian and Neapolitan dialects, to become the
modern Italian, it evidenced the new desire for the popularization of
literature which was a marked characteristic of the dawning era. Not
content with putting his greatest effort in the vernacular, Dante undertook
formally to defend the use of the popular tongue for literary purposes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
This he did in <i>Il Convito</i> ("The Banquet"), a work whose date
is quite uncertain, but which was undoubtedly produced at some time
while its author was in exile. It is essentially a prose commentary upon
three <i>canzoni</i> written for the honor and glory of the "noble, beautiful,
and most compassionate lady, Philosophy." In it Dante sought to set
philosophy free from the schools and from the heavy disputations of the
scholars and to render her beauty visible even to the unlearned. It was
the first important work on philosophy written in the Italian tongue, an
innovation which the author rightly regarded as calling for some explanation
and defense. The passage quoted from it below comprises this
defense. Similar views on the nobility of the vulgar language, as compared
with the Latin, were later set forth in fuller form in the treatise
<i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>.</p>

<p>V. <b>1.</b> This bread being cleansed of its accidental impurities,<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>
we have now but to free it from one [inherent] in its substance,
that is, its being in the vulgar tongue, and not in Latin; so that
we might metaphorically call it made of oats instead of wheat.
<span class="sidebar">Reasons
for using
the Italian</span>
And this [fault] may be briefly excused by three
reasons, which moved me to prefer the former
rather than the latter [language]. The first arises
from care to avoid an unfit order of things; the second, from a
consummate liberality; the third, from a natural love of one's
own tongue. And I intend here in this manner to discuss, in due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
order, these things and their causes, that I may free myself from
the reproach above named.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> For, in the first place, had it [the commentary] been in
Latin, it would have been sovereign rather than subject, by its
nobility, its virtue, and its beauty. By its nobility, because
Latin is enduring and incorruptible, and the vulgar tongue is
unstable and corruptible. For we see that the ancient books of
Latin tragedy and comedy cannot be changed from the form we
<span class="sidebar">The Latin fixed,
the Italian
changeable</span>
have to-day, which is not the case with the vulgar
tongue, as that can be changed at will. For we
see in the cities of Italy, if we take notice of the
past fifty years, how many words have been lost, or invented, or
altered; therefore, if a short time can work such changes, how
much more can a longer period effect! So that I think, should
they who departed this life a thousand years ago return to their
cities, they would believe them to be occupied by a foreign
people, so different would the language be from theirs. Of this
I shall speak elsewhere more fully, in a book which I intend to
write, God willing, on <i>Vulgar Eloquence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>VII. <b>4.</b> ... The Latin could only have explained them
[the <i>canzoni</i>] to scholars; for the rest would not have understood
it. Therefore, as among those who desire to understand them
there are many more illiterate than learned, it follows that the
Latin would not have fulfilled this behest as well as the vulgar
tongue, which is understood both by the learned and the unlearned.
Also the Latin would have explained them to people
of other nations, such as Germans, English, and others; in doing
which it would have exceeded their order.<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> For it would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
been against their will I say, speaking generally, to have explained
<span class="sidebar">Translations
cannot preserve
the literary
splendor
of the originals</span>
their meaning where their beauty could not go with it.
And, moreover, let all observe that nothing
harmonized by the laws of the Muses<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> can be
changed from its own tongue to another one
without destroying all its sweetness and harmony.
And this is the reason why Homer is not turned from
Greek into Latin like the other writings we have of theirs [the
Greeks];<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> and this is why the verses of the Psalter<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> lack musical
sweetness and harmony; for they have been translated from
Hebrew to Greek, and from Greek to Latin, and in the first
translation all this sweetness perished.</p>

<p>IX. <b>1.</b> ... The Latin would not have served many; because,
if we recall to mind what has already been said, scholars
in other languages than the Italian could not have availed themselves
of its service.<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> And of those of this speech (if we should
care to observe who they are) we shall find that only to one in a
thousand could it really have been of use; because they would
not have received it, so prone are they to base desires, and thus
deprived of that nobility of soul which above all desires this
food. And to their shame I say that they are not worthy to be
called scholars, because they do not pursue learning for its own
sake, but for the money or the honors that they gain thereby;
just as we should not call him a lute-player who kept a lute in the
house to hire out, and not to play upon.</p>

<p>X. <b>5.</b> Again, I am impelled to defend it [the vulgar tongue]
from many of its accusers, who disparage it and commend others,
above all the language of <i>Oco</i>,<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> saying that the latter is better and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
more beautiful than the former, wherein they depart from the
truth. Wherefore by this commentary shall be seen the great
excellence of the vulgar tongue of <i>Si</i>,<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> because
<span class="sidebar">The Italian of
more solid excellence
than
other tongues</span>
(although the highest and most novel conceptions
can be almost as fittingly, adequately, and
beautifully expressed in it as in the Latin) its excellence in
rhymed pieces, on account of the accidental adornments connected
with them, such as rhyme and rhythm, or ordered numbers,
cannot be perfectly shown; as it is with the beauty of a
woman, when the splendor of her jewels and her garments draw
more admiration than her person.<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Wherefore he who would
judge a woman truly looks at her when, unaccompanied by any
accidental adornment, her natural beauty alone remains to her;
so shall it be with this commentary, wherein shall be seen the
facility of its language, the propriety of its diction, and the sweet
discourse it shall hold; which he who considers well shall see to
be full of the sweetest and most exquisite beauty. But because
it is most virtuous in its design to show the futility and malice
of its accuser, I shall tell, for the confounding of those who attack
the Italian language, the purpose which moves them to do this;
and upon this I shall now write a special chapter, that their
infamy may be the more notorious.</p>

<p>XI. <b>1.</b> To the perpetual shame and abasement of those wicked
men of Italy who praise the language of others and disparage
<span class="sidebar">Why people of
Italy affect to
despise their
native tongue</span>
their own, I would say that their motive springs
from five abominable causes. The first is intellectual
blindness; the second, vicious excuses;
the third, greed of vain-glory; the fourth, an argument based on
envy; the fifth and last, littleness of soul, that is, pusillanimity.
And each of these vices has so large a following, that few are
they who are free from them....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span></p>

<p><b>3.</b> The second kind work against our language by vicious
excuses. These are they who would rather be considered masters
than be such; and, to avoid the reverse (that is, not to be
considered masters), they always lay the blame upon the materials
prepared for their art, or upon their tools; as the bad
<span class="sidebar">The unskilful
attribute their
faults to the
language</span>
smith blames the iron given him, and the bad
lute-player blames the lute, thinking thus to lay
the fault of the bad knife or the bad playing
upon the iron or the lute, and to excuse themselves. Such are
they (and they are not few) who wish to be considered orators;
and in order to excuse themselves for not speaking, or for speaking
badly, blame and accuse their material, that is, their own
language, and praise that of others in which they are not required
to work. And whoever wishes to see wherein this tool
[the vulgar tongue] deserves blame, let him look at the work
that good workmen have done with it, and he will recognize the
viciousness of those who, laying the blame upon it, think they
excuse themselves. Against such does Tullius exclaim, in the
beginning of one of his books called <i>De Finibus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> because in his
time they blamed the Latin language and commended the Greek,
for the same reasons that these people consider the Italian vile
and the Provençal precious.</p>

<p>XII. <b>3.</b> That thing is nearest to a person which is, of all
things of its kind, the most closely related to himself; thus of
all men the son is nearest to the father, and of all arts medicine
is nearest to the doctor, and music to the musician, because these
are more closely related to them than any others; of all countries,
<span class="sidebar">People should
use their own
language, as
being most natural
to them</span>
the one a man lives in is nearest to him, because it
is most closely related to him. And thus a man's
own language is nearest to him, because most
closely related, being that one which comes alone
and before all others in his mind, and not only of itself is it thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
related, but by accident, inasmuch as it is connected with those
nearest to him, such as his kinsmen, and his fellow-citizens, and
his own people. And this is his own language, which is not only
near, but the very nearest, to every one. Because if proximity
be the seed of friendship, as has been stated above, it is plain
that it has been one of the causes of the love I bear my own
language, which is nearer to me than the others. The above-named
reason (that is, that we are most nearly related to that
which is first in our mind) gave rise to that custom of the people
which makes the firstborn inherit everything, as the nearest of
kin; and, because the nearest, therefore the most beloved.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> And again, its goodness makes me its friend. And here
we must know that every good quality properly belonging to a
thing is lovable in that thing; as men should have a fine beard,
and women should have the whole face quite free from hair; as
the foxhound should have a keen scent, and the greyhound
great speed. And the more peculiar this good quality, the more
lovable it is, whence, although all virtue is lovable in man, that
is most so which is most peculiarly human.... And we
<span class="sidebar">The Italian
fulfils the highest
requirement
of a language</span>
see that, of all things pertaining to language, the
power of adequately expressing thought is the
most loved and commended; therefore this is its
peculiar virtue. And as this belongs to our own
language, as has been proved above in another chapter, it is
plain that this was one of the causes of my love for it; since,
as we have said, goodness is one of the causes that engender
love.</p>

<h4>80. Dante's Conception of the Imperial Power</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The best known prose work of Dante, the <i>De Monarchia</i>, is perhaps
the most purely idealistic political treatise ever written. Its quality
of idealism is so pronounced, in fact, that there is not even sufficient
mention of contemporary men or events to assist in solving the wholly
unsettled problem of the date of its composition. The <i>De Monarchia</i> is
composed of three books, each of which is devoted to a fundamental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
question in relation to the balance of temporal and spiritual authority.
The first question is whether the temporal monarchy is necessary for
the well-being of the world. The answer is, that it is necessary for the
preservation of justice, freedom, and unity and effectiveness of human
effort. The second question is whether the Roman people took to itself
this dignity of monarchy, or empire, by right. By a survey of Roman
history from the days of Æneas to those of Cæsar it is made to appear
that it was God's will that the Romans should rule the world. The
third question is the most vital of all and its answer constitutes the pith
of the treatise. In brief it is, does the authority of the Roman monarch,
or emperor, who is thus by right the monarch of the world, depend immediately
upon God, or upon some vicar of God, the successor of Peter?
This question Dante answers first negatively by clearing away the familiar
defenses of spiritual supremacy, and afterwards positively, by
bringing forward specific arguments for the temporal superiority. The
selection given below comprises the most suggestive portions of Dante's
treatment of this aspect of his subject. The method, it will be observed,
is quite thoroughly scholastic. Whenever the <i>De Monarchia</i> was composed,
it remained all but unknown until after the author's death (1321);
but with the renewal of conflict between papacy and imperial power the
imperialists were not slow to make use of the treatise, and by the middle
of the fourteenth century it had become known throughout Europe, being
admired by one party as much as it was abhorred by the other. At
various times copies of it were burned as heretical and in the sixteenth
century it was placed by the Roman authorities upon the Index of Prohibited
Books. Few literary productions of the later Middle Ages exercised
greater influence upon contemporary thought and politics.</p>

Chaps. 1-16 <i>passim</i>. Translated by Aurelia Henry (Boston, 1904),
pp. 137-206 <i>passim</i>.</p>

<p>I. <b>2.</b> The question pending investigation, then, concerns two
great luminaries, the Roman Pontiff [Pope] and the Roman
Prince [Emperor]; and the point at issue is whether the authority
<span class="sidebar">The problem to
be considered</span>
of the Roman monarch, who, as proved in the
second book, is rightful monarch of the world,
is derived from God directly, or from some vicar or minister of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
God, by whom I mean the successor of Peter, indisputable
keeper of the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>IV. <b>1.</b> Those men to whom the entire subsequent discussion
is directed assert that the authority of the Empire depends on
the authority of the Church, just as the inferior artisan depends
on the architect. They are drawn to this by divers opposing
arguments, some of which they take from Holy Scripture, and
some from certain acts performed by the chief pontiff, and by
the Emperor himself; and they endeavor to make their conviction
reasonable.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> For, first, they maintain that, according to Genesis, God
made two mighty luminaries, a greater and a lesser, the former
to hold supremacy by day and the latter by night [Gen., i. 15, 16].
These they interpret allegorically to be the two rulers&mdash;spiritual
<span class="sidebar">The analogy
of the sun
and moon</span>
and temporal.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Whence they argue that as the
lesser luminary, the moon, has no light but that
gained from the sun, so the temporal ruler has
no authority but that gained from the spiritual ruler.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> I proceed to refute the above assumption that the two
luminaries of the world typify its two ruling powers. The whole
force of their argument lies in the interpretation; but this we
can prove indefensible in two ways. First, since these ruling
powers are, as it were, accidents necessitated by man himself,
God would seem to have used a distorted order in creating first
accidents, and then the subject necessitating them. It is absurd
to speak thus of God, but it is evident from the Word that the
two lights were created on the fourth day, and man on the sixth.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Secondly, the two ruling powers exist as the directors of
men toward certain ends, as will be shown further on. But had
man remained in the state of innocence in which God made him,
he would have required no such direction. These ruling powers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
are therefore remedies against the infirmity of sin. Since on
the fourth day man was not only not a sinner, but was not even
<span class="sidebar">An abstruse
bit of mediæval
reasoning</span>
existent, the creation of a remedy would have been
purposeless, which is contrary to divine goodness.
Foolish indeed would be the physician who
should make ready a plaster for the abscess of a man not yet born.
Therefore it cannot be asserted that God made the two ruling
powers on the fourth day; and consequently the meaning of
Moses cannot have been what it is supposed to be.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Also, in order to be tolerant, we may refute this fallacy
by distinction. Refutation by distinction deals more gently with
an adversary, for it shows him to be not absolutely wrong, as
does refutation by destruction. I say, then, that although the
moon may have abundant light only as she receives it from the
sun, it does not follow on that account that the moon herself
owes her existence to the sun. It must be recognized that the
essence of the moon, her strength, and her function, are not one
and the same thing. Neither in her essence, her strength, nor
her function taken absolutely, does the moon owe her existence
to the sun, for her movement is impelled by her own force and
her influence by her own rays. Besides, she has a certain light
of her own, as is shown in eclipse. It is in order to fulfill her
function better and more potently that she borrows from the
sun abundance of light, and works thereby more effectively.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> In like manner, I say, the temporal power receives from
the spiritual neither its existence, nor its strength, which is its
authority, nor even its function, taken absolutely. But well
<span class="sidebar">Why the argument
from the
sun and moon
fails</span>
for her does she receive therefrom, through the
light of grace which the benediction of the chief
pontiff sheds upon it in heaven and on earth,
strength to fulfill her function more perfectly. So the argument
was at fault in form, because the predicate of the conclusion
is not a term of the major premise, as is evident. The
syllogism runs thus: The moon receives light from the sun, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
is the spiritual power; the temporal ruling power is the moon;
therefore the temporal receives authority from the spiritual.
They introduce "light" as the term of the major, but "authority"
as predicate of the conclusion, which two things we
have seen to be diverse in subject and significance.</p>

<p>VIII. <b>1.</b> From the same gospel they quote the saying of
Christ to Peter, "Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
loosed in heaven" [Matt., xvi. 19], and understand this saying
to refer alike to all the Apostles, according to the text of Matthew
and John [Matt., xviii. 18 and John, xx. 23]. They reason from
<span class="sidebar">Argument
from the prerogative
of the
keys committed
to Peter</span>
this that the successor of Peter has been granted
of God power to bind and loose all things, and
then infer that he has power to loose the laws
and decrees of the Empire, and to bind the laws
and decrees of the temporal kingdom. Were this true, their
inference would be correct.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> But we must reply to it by making a distinction against
the major premise of the syllogism which they employ. Their
syllogism is this: Peter had power to bind and loose all things;
the successor of Peter has like power with him; therefore the
successor of Peter has power to loose and bind all things. From
this they infer that he has power to loose and bind the laws and
decrees of the Empire.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> I concede the minor premise, but the major only with distinction.
Wherefore I say that "all," the symbol of the universal
which is implied in "whatsoever," is never distributed
beyond the scope of the distributed term. When I say, "All animals
run," the distribution of "all" comprehends whatever
comes under the genus "animal." But when I say, "All men
run," the symbol of the universal refers only to whatever comes
under the term "man." And when I say, "All grammarians
run," the distribution is narrowed still further.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Therefore we must always determine what it is over which
the symbol of the universal is distributed; then, from the recognized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
nature and scope of the distributed term, will be easily
apparent the extent of the distribution. Now, were "whatsoever"
to be understood absolutely when it is said, "Whatsoever
thou shalt bind," he would certainly have the power they
claim; nay, he would have even greater power&mdash;he would be able
to loose a wife from her husband, and, while the man still lived,
bind her to another&mdash;a thing he can in nowise do. He would
be able to absolve me, while impenitent&mdash;a thing which God
Himself cannot do.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> So it is evident that the distribution of the term under
discussion is to be taken, not absolutely, but relatively to something
else. A consideration of the concession to which the distribution
is subjoined will make manifest this related something.
<span class="sidebar">Dante's interpretation
of
the Scripture
in question</span>
Christ said to Peter, "I will give unto
thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven;" that
is, I will make thee doorkeeper of the kingdom
of heaven. Then He adds, "and whatsoever," that is, "everything
which," and He means thereby, "Everything which pertains
to that office thou shalt have power to bind and loose."
And thus the symbol of the universal which is implied in "whatsoever"
is limited in its distribution to the prerogative of the
keys of the kingdom of heaven. Understood thus, the proposition
is true, but understood absolutely, it is obviously not.
Therefore I conclude that, although the successor of Peter has
authority to bind and loose in accordance with the requirements
of the prerogative granted to Peter, it does not follow, as they
claim, that he has authority to bind and loose the decrees or
statutes of empire, unless they prove that this also belongs to
the office of the keys. But further on we shall demonstrate that
the contrary is true.</p>

<p>XIII. <b>1.</b> Now that we have stated and rejected the errors on
which those chiefly rely who declare that the authority of the
Roman Prince is dependent on the Roman Pontiff,<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
return and demonstrate the truth of that question which we
propounded for discussion at the beginning. The truth will be
evident enough if it can be shown, under the principle of inquiry
agreed upon, that imperial authority derives immediately from
the summit of all being, which is God. And this will be shown,
whether we prove that imperial authority does not derive from
that of the Church (for the dispute concerns no other authority),
or whether we prove simply that it derives immediately from
God.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> That ecclesiastical authority is not the source of imperial
authority is thus verified. A thing non-existent, or devoid of
active force, cannot be the cause of active force in a thing possessing
that quality in full measure. But before the Church existed,
or while it lacked power to act, the Empire had active force in
<span class="sidebar">The Church
(or papacy) is
not the source
of imperial authority</span>
full measure. Hence the Church is the source,
neither of acting power nor of authority in the
Empire, where power to act and authority are
identical. Let A be the Church, B the Empire,
and C the power or authority of the Empire. If, A being non-existent,
C is in B, the cause of C's relation to B cannot be A,
since it is impossible that an effect should exist prior to its
cause. Moreover, if, A being inoperative, C is in B, the cause of
C's relation to B cannot be A, since it is indispensable for the
production of effect that the cause should be in operation previously,
especially the efficient cause which we are considering
here.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> The major premise of this demonstration is intelligible
from its terms; the minor is confirmed by Christ and the Church.
Christ attests it, as we said before, in His birth and death. The
Church attests it in Paul's declaration to Festus in the Acts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
the Apostles: "I stand at Cæsar's judgment seat, where I ought
to be judged" [Acts, xxv. 10]; and in the admonition of God's
<span class="sidebar">Early Christian
recognition
of the authority
of the
Emperor</span>
angel to Paul a little later: "Fear not, Paul;
thou must be brought before Cæsar" [Acts, xxvii.
24]; and again, still later, in Paul's words to the
Jews dwelling in Italy: "And when the Jews spake
against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I
had aught to accuse my nation of," but "that I might deliver
my soul from death" [Acts, xxviii. 19]. If Cæsar had not
already possessed the right to judge temporal matters, Christ
would not have implied that he did, the angel would not have
uttered such words, nor would he who said, "I desire to depart
and be with Christ" [Phil., i. 23], have appealed to an unqualified
judge.</p>

<p>XIV. <b>1.</b> Besides, if the Church has power to confer authority
on the Roman Prince, she would have it either from God, or
from herself, or from some Emperor, or from the unanimous
consent of mankind, or, at least, from the consent of the most
influential. There is no other least crevice through which the
power could have diffused itself into the Church. But from
none of these has it come to her, and therefore the aforesaid
power is not hers at all.</p>

<p>XVI. <b>1.</b> Although by the method of reduction to absurdity
it has been shown in the foregoing chapter that the authority of
empire has not its source in the Chief Pontiff, yet it has not been
fully proved, save by an inference, that its immediate source
is God, seeing that if the authority does not depend on the vicar
of God, we conclude that it depends on God Himself. For a
perfect demonstration of the proposition we must prove directly
that the Emperor, or Monarch, of the world has immediate
relationship to the Prince of the universe, who is God.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> In order to realize this, it must be understood that man
alone of all beings holds the middle place between corruptibility
and incorruptibility, and is therefore rightly compared by philosophers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
to the horizon which lies between the two hemispheres.
Man may be considered with regard to either of his essential
<span class="sidebar">Positive argument
that the
authority of
the emperor is
derived directly
from God</span>
parts, body or soul. If considered in regard to
the body alone, he is perishable; if in regard to
the soul alone, he is imperishable. So the Philosopher<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>
spoke well of its incorruptibility when
he said in the second book, <i>On the Soul</i>, "And this only can be
separated as a thing eternal from that which perishes."</p>

<p><b>3.</b> If man holds a middle place between the perishable and the
imperishable, then, inasmuch as every man shares the nature of
the extremes, man must share both natures. And inasmuch as
every nature is ordained for a certain ultimate end, it follows
that there exists for man a two-fold end, in order that as he alone
of all beings partakes of the perishable and the imperishable, so
he alone of all beings should be ordained for two ultimate ends.
One end is for that in him which is perishable, the other for that
which is imperishable.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Omniscient Providence has thus designed two ends to be
contemplated by man: first, the happiness of this life, which consists
<span class="sidebar">Double aspect
of human life</span>
in the activity of his natural powers, and is
prefigured by the terrestrial Paradise; and then
the blessedness of life everlasting, which consists in the enjoyment
of the countenance of God, to which man's natural powers
may not obtain unless aided by divine light, and which may be
symbolized by the celestial Paradise.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p><b>5.</b> To these states of blessedness, just as to diverse conclusions,
man must come by diverse means. To the former we come by
the teachings of philosophy, obeying them by acting in conformity
with the moral and intellectual virtues; to the latter, through
spiritual teachings which transcend human reason, and which
we obey by acting in conformity with the theological virtues,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
faith, hope, and charity. Now the former end and means are
made known to us by human reason, which the philosophers
have wholly explained to us; and the latter by the Holy Spirit,
which has revealed to us supernatural but essential truth through
the prophets and sacred writers, through Jesus Christ, the coëternal
Son of God, and through His disciples. Nevertheless, human
passion would cast these behind, were not man, like horses
astray in their brutishness, held to the road by bit and rein.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Wherefore a twofold directive agent was necessary to man,
in accordance with the twofold end; the Supreme Pontiff to lead
the human race to life eternal by means of revelation, and the
Emperor to guide it to temporal well-being by means of philosophic
instruction. And since none or few&mdash;and these with exceeding
<span class="sidebar">The proper
functions of
Pope and Emperor</span>
difficulty&mdash;could attain this port, were
not the waves of seductive desire calmed, and
mankind made free to rest in the tranquillity of
peace, therefore this is the goal which he whom we call the
guardian of the earth and Roman Prince should most urgently
seek; then would it be possible for life on this mortal threshing-floor
to pass in freedom and peace. The order of the world follows
the order inherent in the revolution of the heavens. To
attain this order it is necessary that instruction productive of
liberality and peace should be applied by the guardian of the
realm, in due place and time, as dispensed by Him who is the
ever-present Watcher of the whole order of the heavens. And
He alone foreordained this order, that by it, in His providence,
He might link together all things, each in its own place.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> If this is so, and there is none higher than He, only God
elects and only God confirms. Whence we may further conclude
that neither those who are now, nor those who in any way
whatsoever have been, called electors<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> have the right to be so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
called; rather should they be entitled heralds of Divine Providence.
Whence it is that those in whom is vested the dignity
of proclamation suffer dissension among themselves at times,
when, all or part of them being shadowed by the clouds of
passion, they discern not the face of God's dispensation.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> It is established, then, that the authority of temporal
monarchy descends without mediation from the fountain of
universal authority. And this fountain, one in its purity of
source, flows into multifarious channels out of the abundance
of its excellence.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> I believe I have now approached sufficiently close to the goal
I had set myself, for I have taken the kernels of truth from the
husks of falsehood, in that question which asked whether the
office of monarchy was essential to the welfare of the world, and
in the next which made inquiry whether the Roman people
rightfully appropriated the empire, and in the last which sought
whether the authority of the monarch derived from God directly,
or from some other. But the truth of this final question must
not be restricted to mean that the Roman Prince shall not be
<span class="sidebar">The ideal relation
of the
two powers</span>
subject in some degree to the Roman Pontiff, for
well-being that is mortal is ordered in a measure
after well-being that is immortal. Wherefore let
Cæsar honor Peter as a first-born son should honor his father,
so that, brilliant with the light of paternal grace, he may illumine
with greater radiance the earthly sphere over which he has been
set by Him who alone is Ruler of all things spiritual and temporal.<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<h4>81. Petrarch's Love of the Classics</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>Francesco Petrarca was born at Arezzo in northern Italy in July,
1304. His father was a Florentine notary who had been banished by
the same decree with Dante in 1302, and who finally settled at Avignon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
in 1313 to practice his profession in the neighborhood of the papal court.
Petrarch was destined by his father for the law and was sent to study
that subject at Montpellier and subsequently at Bologna. But from the
moment when he first got hold of the Latin classics, notably Cicero and
Vergil, he found his interest in legal subjects absolutely at an end. He
was charmed by the literary power of the ancients, as he certainly was
not by the logic and learning of the jurists, and though his father endeavored
to discourage what he regarded as a sheer waste of time by
burning the young enthusiast's precious Latin books, the love of the
classics, once aroused, was never crushed out and the literary instinct
remained dominant. The beginnings of the Renaissance spirit, which
are so discernible in Dante, become in Petrarch the full expression of
the new age. In the words of Professor Adams, "In him we clearly
find, as controlling personal traits, all those specific features of the Renaissance
which give it its distinguishing character as an intellectual
revolution, and from their strong beginning in him they have never
ceased among men. In the first place, he felt as no other man had done
since the ancient days the beauty of nature and the pleasure of mere
life, its sufficiency for itself; and he had also a sense of ability and power,
and a self-confidence which led him to plan great things, and to hope
for an immortality of fame in this world. In the second place, he had
a most keen sense of the unity of past history, of the living bond of connection
between himself and men of like sort in the ancient world. That
world was for him no dead antiquity, but he lived and felt in it and with
its poets and thinkers, as if they were his neighbors. His love for it
amounted almost, if we may call it so, to an ecstatic enthusiasm, hardly
understood by his own time, but it kindled in many others a similar
feeling which has come down to us. The result is easily recognized in
him as a genuine culture, the first of modern men in whom this can be
found.... Finally, Petrarch first put the modern spirit into conscious
opposition to the mediæval. The Renaissance meant rebellion
and revolution. It meant a long and bitter struggle against the whole
scholastic system, and all the follies and superstitions which flourished
under its protection. Petrarch opened the attack along the whole line.
Physicians, lawyers, astrologers, scholastic philosophers, the universities&mdash;all
were enemies of the new learning, and so his enemies. And these
attacks were not in set and formal polemics alone, his letters and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
almost all his writings were filled with them. It was the business of
his life."<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>In the latter part of his life Petrarch enjoyed the highest renown
throughout Europe. The cities of Italy, especially, vied with one another
in showering honors upon him. A decree of the Venetian senate affirmed
that no Christian poet or philosopher could be compared with him.
Arezzo, the town of his birth, awarded him a triumphal procession.
Florence bought the estates once confiscated from his father and begged
him to accept them as a meager gift to one "who for centuries had no
equal and could scarcely find one in the ages to come." The climax
came in 1341 when both the University of Paris and the Roman Senate
invited him to present himself and receive the poet's crown, in revival
of an old and all but forgotten ceremony of special honor. The invitation
from Rome was accepted and the celebration attending the coronation
was one of the most splendid of the age. In 1350 Petrarch became
acquainted with Boccaccio and thenceforth there existed the warmest
friendship between these two great exponents of Renaissance ideals and
achievement. In 1369 he retired to Arquà, near Padua, where he died
in 1374.</p>

<p>Besides his poems Petrarch wrote a great number of letters, some in
Latin and some in Italian. Letter-writing was indeed a veritable passion
with him; and he not only wrote freely but was careful to preserve copies
of what he wrote. His prose correspondence has been classified in four
divisions. The largest one comprises three hundred forty-seven letters,
written between the years 1332 and 1362, and given the general title of
<i>De Rebus Familiaribus</i>, because in them only topics presumably of everyday
interest were discussed and without particular attention to style.
The second group, the so-called <i>Epistolæ Variæ</i>, numbers about seventy.
The third, the <i>Epistolæ de Rebus Senilibus</i> ("Letters of Old Age"), includes
one hundred twenty-four letters written during the last twelve
years of the poet's life. The fourth, comprising about twenty letters,
was made up of epistles containing such sharp criticism of the papal
régime at Avignon that the author thought it best to suppress the names
of those to whom they were addressed. Their general designation,
therefore, is <i>Epistolæ sine Titulo</i>. The following passages are taken from
a letter found in the <i>Epistolæ Variæ</i>. It was written to a literary friend,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
August 18, 1360, while Petrarch was at Milan, uncertain whither the political
storms of the period would finally drive him. In the portion which
precedes that given below the writer has been commenting on various
invitations which had reached him from friends in Padua, Florence,
and even beyond the Alps. This gives him occasion to lament the
unsettled conditions of his times and to voice the longing of the scholar
for peace and quiet. Thence he proceeds to speak of matters which
reveal in an interesting way his passionate love for the beauties of classical
literature and his sympathy with its dominant ideas. Cicero was his
favorite Latin author; after him, Vergil and Ovid. Greek literature,
unfortunately, it was impossible for him to know at first hand. In spite
of a lifelong desire, and at least one determined effort (which is referred
to in the letter below), he never acquired even a rudimentary reading
knowledge of the Greek language. At best he could only read fragments
of Homer, Plato, and Aristotle in extremely faulty Latin translations.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>If you should ask me, in the midst of these opinions of my
friends, what I myself think of the matter, I can only reply that
I long for a place where solitude, leisure, repose, and silence
reign, however far from wealth and honors, power and favors.
But I confess I know not where to find it. My own secluded
nook, where I have hoped not only to live, but even to die, has
lost all the advantages it once possessed, even that of safety.
<span class="sidebar">Petrarch's
longing for
peace and
seclusion</span>
I call to witness thirty or more volumes, which
I left there recently, thinking that no place
could be more secure, and which, a little later,
having escaped from the hands of robbers and returned, against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
all hope, to their master, seem yet to blanch and tremble and
show upon their foreheads the troubled condition of the place
whence they have escaped. Therefore I have lost all hope of
revisiting this charming retreat, this longed-for country spot.
Still, if the opportunity were offered me, I should seize it with
both hands and hold it fast. I do not know whether I still
possess a glimmer of hope, or am feigning it for self-deception,
and to feed my soul's desire with empty expectation.</p>

<p>But I proceed, remembering that we had much conversation on
this point last year, when we lived together in the same house, in
this very city [Milan]; and that after having examined the matter
most carefully, in so far as our light permitted, we came to the
conclusion that while the affairs of Italy, and of Europe, remain
in this condition, there is no place safer and better for my
needs than Milan, nor any place that suits me so well. We
made exception only of the city of Padua, whither I went
<span class="sidebar">Drawbacks of
even Milan
and Padua</span>
shortly after and whither I shall soon return;
not that I may obliterate or diminish&mdash;that I
should not wish&mdash;but that I may soften the
regret which my absence causes the citizens of both places. I
know not whether you have changed your opinion since that
time; but for me I am convinced that to exchange the tumult
of this great city and its annoyances for the annoyances of
another city would bring me no advantage, perhaps some inconvenience,
and beyond a doubt, much fatigue. Ah, if this
tranquil solitude, which, in spite of all my seeking, I never
find, as I have told you, should ever show itself on any side,
you will hear, not that I have gone, but that I have flown, to
it....</p>

<p>In the succeeding paragraph of your letter you jest with much
elegance, saying that I have been wounded by Cicero without
having deserved it, on account of our too great intimacy.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
"Because," you say, "those who are nearest to us most often
injure us, and it is extremely rare that an Indian does an injury
<span class="sidebar">Common
indifference
to people and
events near at
hand</span>
to a Spaniard." True it is. It is on this account
that in reading of the wars of the Athenians
and Lacedaemonians, and in contemplating the
troubles of our own people with our neighbors,
we are never struck with astonishment; still less so at the sight
of the civil wars and domestic troubles which habit has made
of so little account that concord itself would more easily cause
surprise. But when we read that the king of Scythia has come
to blows with the king of Egypt, and that Alexander of Macedonia
has penetrated to the ends of India, we experience a sensation
of astonishment which the reading of our histories, filled
as they are with the deeds of Roman bravery in their distant
expeditions, does not afford. You bring me consolation, in
representing me as having been wounded by Cicero, to whom I
am fondly attached, a thing that would probably never happen
to me, at the hands of either Hippocrates<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> or Albumazar....<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

Leo<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> may translate it from Greek into Latin
for your benefit and for the benefit of our other
studious compatriots. I saw this book, but
neglected the opportunity of acquiring it, because it seemed
inferior to my own. It can easily be had with the aid of the
person to whom I owe my friendship with Leo; a letter from
that source would be all-powerful in the matter, and I will myself
write him.</p>

<p>If by chance the book escape us, which seems to be very
unlikely, I will let you have mine. I have been always fond of
this particular translation and of Greek literature in general,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
and if fortune had not frowned upon my beginnings, in the sad
death of my excellent master, I should be perhaps to-day something
<span class="sidebar">Fondness
for Greek
literature</span>
more than a Greek still at his alphabet. I
approve with all my heart and strength your
enterprise, for I regret and am indignant that an
ancient translation, presumably the work of Cicero, the commencement
of which Horace inserted in his <i>Ars Poetica</i>,<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> should
have been lost to the Latin world, together with many other
works. It angers me to see so much solicitude for the bad and
so much neglect of the good. But what is to be done? We
must be resigned....</p>

<p>I wish to take this opportunity of warning you of one thing,
lest later on I should regret having passed it over in silence.
If, as you say, the translation is to be made literally in prose,
listen for a moment to the opinion of St. Jerome as expressed in
his preface to the book, <i>De Temporibus</i>, by Eusebius of Cæsarea,
which he translated into Latin.<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> Here are the very words of this
great man, well acquainted with these two languages, and indeed
with many others, and of special fame for his art of translating:
<span class="sidebar">Difficulty
of translating
works of literature</span>
<i>If any one</i>, he says, <i>refuses to believe that translation
lessens the peculiar charm of the original, let
him render Homer into Latin, word for word; I
will say further, let him translate it into prose in his own tongue,
and he will see a ridiculous array and the most eloquent of poets
transformed into a stammerer.</i> I tell you this for your own good,
while it is yet time, in order that so important a work may not
prove useless. As for me, I wish the work to be done, whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
well or ill. I am so famished for literature that just as he who is
ravenously hungry is not inclined to quarrel with the cook's
art, so I await with a lively impatience whatever dishes are to be
set before my soul. And in truth, the morsel in which the same
Leo, translating into Latin prose the beginning of Homer, has
<span class="sidebar">Longing for
the translation
of Homer</span>
given me a foretaste of the whole work, although
it confirms the sentiment of St. Jerome, does not
displease me. It possesses, in fact, a secret charm,
as certain viands, which have failed to take a moulded shape,
although they are lacking in form, preserve nevertheless their
taste and odor. May he continue with the aid of Heaven, and
may he give us Homer, who has been lost to us!</p>

<p>In asking of me the volume of Plato which I have with me,
and which escaped the fire at my transalpine country house,
you give me proof of your ardor, and I shall hold this book at
<span class="sidebar">A loan of a
volume of
Plato</span>
your disposal, whenever the time shall come.
I wish to aid with all my power such noble enterprises.
But beware lest it should be unbecoming
to unite in one bundle these two great princes of Greece, lest
the weight of these two spirits should overwhelm mortal shoulders.
Let your messenger undertake, with God's aid, one of the two,
and first him who has written many centuries before the other.
Farewell.</p>

<h4>82. Petrarch's Letter to Posterity</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The following is a letter of Petrarch addressed, by a curious whim, to
Posterity. It gives an excellent idea of the poet's opinion of himself and
reveals the sort of things that interested the typical man of culture in
the early Renaissance period. It is supposed to have been written in
the year 1370, when Petrarch had completed the sixty-sixth year of
his life. The letter betrays a longing for individual fame which was
common in classical times and during the Renaissance, but not in the
Middle Ages.

<p><i>Francis Petrarch, to Posterity, greeting</i>:</p>

<p>It is possible that some word of me may have come to you,
though even this is doubtful, since an insignificant and obscure
name will scarcely penetrate far in either time or space. If,
however, you should have heard of me, you may desire to know
what manner of man I was, or what was the outcome of my
labors, especially those of which some description or, at any
rate, the bare titles may have reached you.</p>

<p>To begin, then, with myself. The utterances of men concerning
me will differ widely, since in passing judgment almost every
one is influenced not so much by truth as by preference, and good
and evil report alike know no bounds. I was, in truth, a poor
<span class="sidebar">Petrarch's
early life</span>
mortal like yourself, neither very exalted in my
origin, nor, on the other hand, of the most humble
birth, but belonging, as Augustus Cæsar says of himself,
to an ancient family. As to my disposition, I was not naturally
perverse or wanting in modesty, however the contagion of evil
associations may have corrupted me.</p>

<p>My youth was gone before I realized it; I was carried away by
the strength of manhood. But a riper age brought me to my
senses and taught me by experience the truth I had long before
read in books, that youth and pleasure are vanity&mdash;nay, that
the Author of all ages and times permits us miserable mortals,
puffed up with emptiness, thus to wander about, until finally,
coming to a tardy consciousness of our sins, we shall learn to
know ourselves.</p>

<p>In my prime I was blessed with a quick and active body, although
not exceptionally strong; and while I do
<span class="sidebar">Physical
appearance</span>
not lay claim to remarkable personal beauty, I
was comely enough in my best days. I was possessed of a clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
complexion, between light and dark, lively eyes, and for long
years a keen vision, which, however, deserted me, contrary to
my hopes, after I reached my sixtieth birthday, and forced
me, to my great annoyance, to resort to glasses.<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Although I had
previously enjoyed perfect health, old age brought with it the
usual array of discomforts.</p>

<p>My parents were honorable folk, Florentine in their origin, of
medium fortune, or, I may as well admit it, in a condition verging
upon poverty. They had been expelled from their native city,<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
and consequently I was born in exile, at Arezzo, in the year 1304
of this latter age, which begins with Christ's birth, July the 20th,
on a Monday, at dawn. I have always possessed an extreme
contempt for wealth; not that riches are not desirable in themselves,
but because I hate the anxiety and care which are invariably
associated with them. I certainly do not long to be
able to give gorgeous banquets. I have, on the contrary, led a
<span class="sidebar">Preference for
plain and sensible
living</span>
happier existence with plain living and ordinary
fare than all the followers of Apicius,<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> with their
elaborate dainties. So-called convivia, which
are but vulgar bouts, sinning against sobriety and good manners,
have always been repugnant to me. I have ever felt that it was
irksome and profitless to invite others to such affairs, and not
less so to be bidden to them myself. On the other hand, the
pleasure of dining with one's friends is so great that nothing
has ever given me more delight than their unexpected arrival,
nor have I ever willingly sat down to table without a companion.
Nothing displeases me more than display, for not only is it bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
in itself and opposed to humility, but it is troublesome and distracting.</p>

<p>In my familiar associations with kings and princes, and in
my friendship with noble personages, my good fortune has been
such as to excite envy. But it is the cruel fate of those who
<span class="sidebar">Intimacy with
renowned men</span>
are growing old that they can commonly only
weep for friends who have passed away. The
greatest kings of this age have loved and courted me. They
may know why; I certainly do not. With some of them I was
on such terms that they seemed in a certain sense my guests
rather than I theirs; their lofty position in no way embarrassing
me, but, on the contrary, bringing with it many advantages.
I fled, however, from many of those to whom I was greatly attached;
and such was my innate longing for liberty that I
studiously avoided those whose very name seemed incompatible
with the freedom that I loved.</p>

<p>I possessed a well-balanced rather than a keen intellect&mdash;one
prone to all kinds of good and wholesome study, but especially
inclined to moral philosophy and the art of poetry.
The latter, indeed, I neglected as time went on, and took delight
in sacred literature. Finding in that a hidden sweetness
which I had once esteemed but lightly, I came to regard the
works of the poets as only amenities.</p>

<p>Among the many subjects that interested me, I dwelt especially
upon antiquity, for our own age has always repelled me,
<span class="sidebar">Admiration
for antiquity</span>
so that, had it not been for the love of those
dear to me, I should have preferred to have been
born in any other period than our own. In order to forget my
own time, I have constantly striven to place myself in spirit
in other ages, and consequently I delighted in history. The
conflicting statements troubled me, but when in doubt I accepted
what appeared most probable, or yielded to the authority
of the writer.</p>

<p>My style, as many claimed, was clear and forcible; but to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
me it seemed weak and obscure. In ordinary conversation with
friends, or with those about me, I never gave thought to my language,
and I have always wondered that Augustus Cæsar should
<span class="sidebar">Attitude toward
literary
style</span>
have taken such pains in this respect. When,
however, the subject itself, or the place or the
listener, seemed to demand it, I gave some attention
to style, with what success I cannot pretend to say;
let them judge in whose presence I spoke. If only I have lived
well, it matters little to me how I talked. Mere elegance of
language can produce at best but an empty renown....</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
FORESHADOWINGS OF THE REFORMATION</h3>

<h4>83. The Reply of Wyclif to the Summons of Pope Urban VI. (1384)</h4>

<div class="intro">
<p>The fourteenth century was an era of religious decline in England,
as indeed more or less generally throughout western Europe. The papacy
was at its lowest ebb, unable to command either respect or obedience,
except among the clergy and certain of the common people; bishops
and abbots had grown wealthy and worldly and were often utterly neglectful
of their religious obligations; and among the masses the services
of worship had frequently become mere hollow formalities. There
were still many good men in the Church, men who in an unpretentious
way sought to do their duty faithfully; but of large numbers&mdash;possibly
the majority&mdash;of both the higher and lower clergy this could not be said.
The dissatisfaction of the people with industrial conditions which
prompted the uprising of 1381 was accompanied by an almost equal
discontent with the shortcomings of the selfish and avaricious clergy.
It was harder, of course, to arouse men to an active hostility to the
existing ecclesiastical system than to the industrial régime, because the
Church still maintained a very close hold upon the sentiments and attachments
of the average individual. Still, there were people here and
there who were outspoken for reform, and chief among these was John
Wyclif.</p>

<p>Wyclif was born in Yorkshire about 1320 and was educated at Oxford,
where in time he became a leading teacher. He was one of those who
saw clearly the evils of the times and did not lack the courage to speak
out plainly against them. As early as 1366 he had denounced the claims
of the papacy, in a pamphlet, <i>De Dominio Divino</i>, declaring that the
pope ought to have no authority whatsoever over states and governments.
This position he never yielded and it became one of the cardinal
features of his teaching. He attacked the clergy for their wealth, their
self-seeking, and their subservience to the pope, and hurled denunciation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
at the whole body of friars and vendors of indulgences with whom England
was thronged. He even assailed the doctrines of the Church,
particularly as to transubstantiation, the efficacy of confession to priests,
and the nature of the sacraments. His teachings were very acceptable to
large numbers of people who were disgusted with existing conditions,
and hence he soon came to have a considerable body of followers, known
as the Lollards, who, though not regularly organized into a sect, carried
on in later times the work which Wyclif and his "poor priests" had begun.</p>

<p>In 1377 Pope Gregory XI. issued a bull in which he roundly condemned
Wyclif and reproved the University of Oxford for not taking active steps
to suppress the growing heresy; but it had little or no effect. In 1378
Gregory died and two popes were elected to succeed him&mdash;Clement VII.
at Avignon and Urban VI. at Rome [see <a href="#Page_389">p. 389</a>]. The Schism that
resulted prevented further action for a time against Wyclif. In England,
however, the uprising of 1381 aroused the government to the expediency
of suppressing popular agitators, and in a church council at London,
May 19, 1382, Wyclif's doctrines were formally condemned. In 1383
Oxford was compelled to banish all the Lollards from her walls and by
the time of Wyclif's death in 1384 the new belief seemed to be pretty
thoroughly suppressed. In reality it lived on by the more or less secret
attachment of thousands of people to it, and became one of the great
preparatory forces for the English Reformation a century and a half
later. The document given below is a modernized version of a letter
written by Wyclif to Pope Urban VI. in 1384 in response to a summons
to appear at Rome to be tried for heresy. The letter was written in
Latin and the English translation (given below) prepared by the writer's
followers for distribution among Englishmen represents somewhat of an
enlargement of the original document. When Wyclif wrote the letter
he was in the last year of his life and was so disabled by paralysis that
a journey to Rome was quite impossible.</p>

<p>I have joyfully to tell what I hold, to all true men that believe,
and especially to the pope; for I suppose that if my faith be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
rightful and given of God, the pope will gladly confirm it; and
if my faith be error, the pope will wisely amend it.</p>

<p>I suppose over this that the gospel of Christ be heart of the
corps [body] of God's law; for I believe that Jesus Christ, that
gave in His own person this gospel, is very God and very man,
and by this heart passes all other laws.</p>

<p>I suppose over this that the pope be most obliged to the
keeping of the gospel among all men that live here; for the pope is
<span class="sidebar">The pope's
high obligation</span>
highest vicar that Christ has here in earth. For
moreness of Christ's vicar is not measured by
worldly moreness, but by this, that this vicar
follows more Christ by virtuous living; for thus teacheth the
gospel, that this is the sentence of Christ.</p>

<p>And of this gospel I take as believe, that Christ for time that
He walked here, was most poor man of all, both in spirit and in
having [possessions]; for Christ says that He had nought for to
rest His head on. And Paul says that He was made needy for
<span class="sidebar">Christ's earthly
poverty</span>
our love. And more poor might no man be,
neither bodily nor in spirit. And thus Christ put
from Him all manner of worldly lordship. For the gospel of John
telleth that when they would have made Christ king, He fled
and hid Him from them, for He would none such worldly highness.</p>

<p>And over this I take it as believe, that no man should follow
the pope, nor no saint that now is in heaven, but in as much as he
[the pope] follows Christ. For John and James erred when they
<span class="sidebar">How far men
ought to follow
the pope</span>
coveted worldly highness; and Peter and Paul
sinned also when they denied and blasphemed
in Christ; but men should not follow them in
this, for then they went from Jesus Christ. And this I take as
wholesome counsel, that the pope leave his worldly lordship to
<span class="sidebar">The pope exhorted
to give
up temporal
authority</span>
worldly lords, as Christ gave them,&mdash;and more
speedily all his clerks [clergy] to do so. For
thus did Christ, and taught thus His disciples,
till the fiend [Satan] had blinded this world. And it seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
to some men that clerks that dwell lastingly in this error against
God's law, and flee to follow Christ in this, been open heretics,
and their fautors [supporters] been partners.</p>

<p>And if I err in this sentence, I will meekly be amended [corrected],
yea, by the death, if it be skilful [necessary], for that I
hope were good to me. And if I might travel in mine own person,
I would with good will go to the pope. But God has needed me
to the contrary, and taught me more obedience to God than to
men. And I suppose of our pope that he will not be Antichrist,
and reverse Christ in this working, to the contrary of Christ's
will; for if he summon against reason, by him or by any of his,
<span class="sidebar">The pope
should not demand
what is
contrary to the
divine will</span>
and pursue this unskilful summoning, he is an
open Antichrist. And merciful intent excused
not Peter, that Christ should not clepe [call] him
Satan; so blind intent and wicked counsel excuses
not the pope here; but if he ask of true priests that they
travel more than they may, he is not excused by reason of God,
that he should not be Antichrist. For our belief teaches us that
our blessed God suffers us not to be tempted more than we may;
how should a man ask such service? And therefore pray we to
God for our Pope Urban the Sixth, that his old [early] holy intent
be not quenched by his enemies. And Christ, that may not lie,
says that the enemies of a man been especially his home family;
and this is sooth of men and fiends.

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he difficulties usually encountered in treating mediaeval
and modern history are here overcome by an easy and
satisfactory method. By this plan Italy, France, Germany,
and England are taken up in turn as each becomes the
central figure on the world's stage. The first part of the book
is devoted to the period previous to the Reformation; the
second to modern history from the Reformation to the French
Revolution; and the remainder to the century and a quarter
since the occurrence of that great event. This arrangement
gives an opportunity to discuss the greatness of England, the
unification of Italy and of Germany, and the present organization
of Europe under control of the concert of powers, on
the same plane as the Crusades, or the Thirty Years' War, or
the age of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>¶ The three most difficult problems in mediaeval history&mdash;the
feudal state, the church, and the rivalry between the empire
and the church&mdash;are here discussed with great clearness
and brevity. The central idea of the book is the development
of the principle of national independence in both politics and
religion from the earlier condition of a world empire.</p>

<p>¶ For the convenience of those wishing a text-book on
Mediaeval History alone, the period from Charlemagne to the
close of the fifteenth century is issued in separate form.</p>

From the Earliest Records to Charlemagne. By ARTHUR

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his volume belongs to the Essentials in History Series,
which follows the plan recommended by the Committee
of Seven, and adopted by the College Entrance Examination
Board, and by the New York State Education Department.
The pedagogic apparatus is amply sufficient for any
secondary school.</p>

<p>¶ The essentials in ancient history are presented as a unit,
beginning with the earliest civilization in the East, and ending
with the establishment of the Western Empire by Charlemagne.
More attention is paid to civilization than to mere
constitutional development, the latter being brought out in the
narrative, rather than as a series of separate episodes.</p>

<p>¶ A departure has been made from the time-honored method
of carrying the subject down to the end of Greek political life
before beginning the story of Rome. The history of the two
civilizations is not entirely distinct; hence, it has seemed wise,
after completing the account of the life and work of Alexander,
to tell the story of the beginnings of Rome. Afterwards
the history of the East is resumed, and carried on to the point
where it merges into that of Rome. Should any teacher,
however, prefer the old method of treating the two nations,
he has only to take up Chapters XXIV and XXV before
Chapters XVIII to XXIII. The Roman Empire, a very
important but much neglected period of history, is brought
out in its just proportions, and with reference to the events
which had the greatest influence.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>rofessor Hart was a member of the Committee
of Seven, and consequently is exceptionally qualified to
supervise the preparation of a series of text-books which
carry out the ideas of that Committee. The needs of secondary
schools, and the entrance requirements to all colleges,
are fully met by the Essentials in History Series.</p>

<p>¶ This volume reflects in an impressive manner the writer's
broad grasp of the subject, his intimate knowledge of the
relative importance of events, his keen insight into the cause
and effect of each noteworthy occurrence, and his thorough
familiarity with the most helpful pedagogical features&mdash;all of
which make the work unusually well suited to students.</p>

<p>¶ The purpose of the book is to present an adequate description
of all essential things in the upbuilding of the country,
and to supplement this by good illustrations and maps.
Political geography, being the background of all historical
knowledge, is made a special topic, while the development of
government, foreign relations, the diplomatic adjustment of
controversies, and social and economic conditions have been
duly emphasized.</p>

<p>¶ All sections of the Union, North, East, South, West, and
Far West, have received fair treatment. Much attention is
paid to the causes and results of our various wars, but only the
most significant battles and campaigns have been described.
The book aims to make distinct the character and public
services of some great Americans, brief accounts of whose lives
are given in special sections of the text. Towards the end a
chapter sums up the services of America to mankind.</p>

this text-book is intended to form a year's work in

of the Committee of Seven, and meeting the requirements of
the College Entrance Examination Board, and of the New
York State Education Department. It contains the same
general features, the same pedagogic apparatus, and the same
topical method of treatment. The text is continuous, the
sectional headings being placed in the margin. The maps
and illustrations are worthy of special mention.</p>

<p>¶ The book is a model of good historical exposition, unusually
clear in expression, logical and coherent in arrangement,
and accurate in statement. The essential facts in the
development of the British Empire are vividly described, and
the relation of cause and effect is clearly brought out.</p>

<p>¶ The treatment begins with a brief survey of the whole
course of English history, deducing therefrom three general
movements: (1) the fusing of several races into the English
people; (2) the solution by that people of two great
problems: free and democratic home government, and practical,
enlightened government of foreign dependencies; and
(3) the extreme development of two great fields of industry,
commerce and manufacture. The narrative follows the
chronological order, and is full of matter which is as interesting
as it is significant, ending with a masterly summary of
England's contribution to civilization.</p>

selected essays, which are intended to trace the development

The choice of material has been influenced by something
more than mere style. An underlying coherence in content,
typical of the thought of the era in question, may be traced
throughout. With but few exceptions the selections are given
in their entirety.</p>

<p>¶ The essays cover a definite period, and exhibit the individuality
of each author's method of criticism. In each case
they are those most typical of the author's critical principles,
and at the same time representative of the critical tendencies
of his age. The subject-matter provides interesting material
for intensive study and class room discussion, and each essay
is an example of excellent, though varying, style.</p>

<p>¶ They represent not only the authors who write, but the
authors who are treated. The essays provide the best things
that have been said by England's critics on Swift, on Scott,
on Macaulay, and on Emerson.</p>

<p>¶ The introductions and notes provide the necessary biographical
matter, suggestive points for the use of the teacher
in stimulating discussion of the form or content of the essays,
and such aids as will eliminate those matters of detail that
might prove stumbling blocks to the student. Though the
essays are in chronological order, they may be treated at random

covers a wider range of topics on the nature, origin,
organization, and functions of the state than is found
in any other college textbook published in the English language.
The unusually comprehensive treatment of the various
topics is based on a wide reading of the best literature on the
subject in English, German, French, and Italian, and the
student has opportunity to profit by this research work through
the bibliographies placed at the head of each chapter, as well
as by means of many additional references in the footnotes.</p>

<p>¶ An introductory chapter is followed by chapters on the
nature and essential elements of the state; on the various
theories concerning the origin of the state; on the forms of
the state; on the forms of government, including a discussion
of the elements of strength and weakness of each; on sovereignty,
its nature, its essential characteristics, and its abiding
place in the state; on the functions and sphere of the state,
including the various theories of state activity; and on the
organization of the state. In addition there are chapters on
constitutions, their nature, forms, and development; on the
distribution of the powers of government; on the electorate;
and on citizenship and nationality.</p>

<p>¶ Before stating his own conclusions the author gives an impartial
discussion of the more important theories of the origin,
nature, and functions of the state, and analyzes and criticises
them in the light of the best scientific thought and practice.
Thus the pupil becomes familiar with the history of the science
as well as with its principles as recognized to-day.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In chapters 11-20, immediately preceding the present passage, Cæsar
gives a comparatively full and minute description of Gallic life and institutions.
He knew more about the Gauls than about the Germans, and,
besides, it was his experiences among them that he was writing about
primarily.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The Druids were priests who formed a distinct and very influential
class among the Gauls. They ascertained and revealed the will of the gods
and were supreme in the government of the tribes. Druids existed also
among the Britons.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> By Vulcan Cæsar means the German god of fire.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Of the Suevi, a German tribe living along the upper course of the Danube,
Cæsar says: "They consider it their greatest glory as a nation that the lands
about their territories lie unoccupied to a very great extent, for they think
that by this it is shown that a great number of nations cannot withstand
their power; and thus on one side of the Suevi the lands are said to lie
desolate for about six hundred miles."&mdash;<i>Gallic War</i>, Bk. IV., Chap. 3.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> This statement is an instance of Cæsar's vagueness, due possibly to haste
in writing, but more likely to lack of definite information. How large these
districts and cantons were, whether they had fixed boundaries, and how
the chiefs rendered justice in them are things we should like to know but
are not told.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> All dates from this point, unless otherwise indicated, are <span class="s07">A.D.</span></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> In reality iron ore was abundant in the Germans' territory, but it was
not until long after the time of Tacitus that much use began to be made of
it. By the fifth century iron swords were common.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The canton was known to the Romans as a <i>pagus</i> and to the Germans
themselves as a <i>gau</i>. It was made up of a number of districts, or
townships (Latin <i>vicus</i>, German <i>dorf</i>), and was itself a division of a tribe or
nation.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> A later law of the Salian Franks imposed a fine of 120 <i>denarii</i> upon any
man who should accuse another of throwing down his shield and running
away, without being able to prove it [see <a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>].</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Many of the western tribes at the time Tacitus wrote did not have kings,
though in eastern Germany the institution of kingship seems to have been
quite general. The office, where it existed, was elective, but the people
rarely chose a king outside of a privileged family, assumed to be of divine
origin.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Evidently these were not images of their gods, for in another place (Chap.
9) Tacitus tells us that the Germans deemed it a dishonor to their deities to
represent them in human form. The images were probably those of wild
beasts, as the wolf of Woden (or Odin), or the ram of Tyr, and were national
standards preserved with religious care in the sacred groves, whence they
were brought forth when the tribe was on the point of going to war.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The German popular assembly was simply the periodical gathering of
free men in arms for the discussion and decision of important points of tribal
policy. It was not a legislative body in the modern sense. Law among the
Germans was immemorial custom, which, like religion, could be changed
only by a gradual shifting of popular belief and practice. It was not "made"
by any process of deliberate and immediate choice. Nevertheless, the assembly
constituted an important democratic element in the government, which
operated in a measure to offset the aristocratic element represented by the
<i>principes</i> and <i>comitatus</i> [see <a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>]. Its principal functions were the declaring
of war and peace, the election of the kings, and, apparently, the hearing
and deciding of graver cases at law.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> This relation of <i>principes</i> (chiefs) and <i>comites</i> (companions) is mentioned
by Cæsar [see <a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>]. The name by which the Romans designated the band
of companions, or followers, of a German chieftain was <i>comitatus</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Apparently the Germans did not now care much more for agriculture
than in the time of Cæsar. The women, slaves, and old men sowed some
seeds and gathered small harvests, but the warrior class held itself above
such humble and unexciting employment. The raising of cattle afforded
a principal means of subsistence, though hunting and fishing contributed
considerably.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The Germans had no system of taxation on land or other property, such
as the Romans had and such as we have to-day. It was not until well toward
the close of the Middle Ages that the governments of kingdoms built
up by Germanic peoples in western Europe came to be maintained by anything
like what we would call taxes in the modern sense.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The lack of cities and city life among the Germans struck Tacitus with
the greater force because of the complete dominance of city organization to
which he, as a Roman, was accustomed. The Greek and Roman world was
made up, in the last analysis, of an aggregation of <i>civitates</i>, or city states.
Among the ancient Greeks these had usually been independent; among the
Romans they were correlated under the greater or lesser control of a centralized
government; but among the Germans of Tacitus's time, and long
after, the mixed agricultural and nomadic character of the people effectually
prevented the development of anything even approaching urban organization.
Their life was that of the forest and the pasture, not that of forum,
theatre, and circus.</p>

of Adrianople in 378. His brother Valentinian was emperor in the West
from 364 to 375. Gratian, son of Valentinian, was the real sovereign in the
West when the Visigoths crossed the Danube.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> M&oelig;ller (<i>Histoire du Moyen Age</i>, p. 58), estimates that the Goths who now
entered Thrace numbered not fewer than 200,000 grown men, accompanied
by their wives and children. The Italian Villari, in his <i>Barbarian Invasions
of Italy</i>, Vol. I., p. 49, gives the same estimate. The tendency of contemporary
chroniclers to exaggerate numbers has misled many older writers. Even
M&oelig;ller's and Villari's estimate would mean a total of upwards of a million
people. That there were so many may well be doubted. The Vandals
played practically as important a part in the history of their times as did the
Visigoths; yet it is known that when the Vandals passed through Spain, in
the first half of the fifth century, they numbered not more than 20,000
fighting men, with their wives and children.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> The Visigoths under Fridigern finally took their position near Adrianople
and Valens led his army into that vicinity and pitched his camp, fortifying
it with a rampart of palisades. From the Western emperor, Gratian, a
messenger came asking that open conflict be postponed until the army from
Rome could join that from Constantinople. But Valens, easily flattered by
some of his over-confident generals, foolishly decided to bring on a battle
at once. Apparently he did not dream that defeat was possible.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> After the battle here described, which occurred in the open plain, the
victorious Goths proceeded to the siege of the city itself, in which, however,
they were unsuccessful. The taking of fortified towns was an art in which
the Germans were not skilled.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> When both armies were in position Fridigern, "being skilful in divining
the future," says Ammianus, "and fearing a doubtful struggle," sent a
herald to Valens with the promise that if the Romans would give hostages
to the Goths the latter would cease their depredations and even aid the Romans
in their wars. Richomeres, the Roman cavalry leader, was chosen
by Valens to serve as a hostage; but as he was proceeding to the Gothic
camp the soldiers who accompanied him made a rash attack upon a division
of the enemy and precipitated a battle which soon spread to the whole
army.</p>

fourth century. For a time he followed his father's profession as a soldier in
the service of the Roman emperor, but later he went to Gaul with the purpose
of aiding in the establishment of the Christian Church in that quarter.
In 372 he was elected bishop of Tours and shortly afterwards he founded the
monastery with which his name was destined to be associated throughout
the Middle Ages. This monastery, which was one of the earliest in western
Europe, became a very important factor in the prolonged combat with Gallic
paganism, and subsequently a leading center of ecclesiastical learning.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_41" id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Ægidius and his son Syagrius were the last official representatives of the
Roman imperial power in Gaul; and since the fall of the Empire in the
West even they had taken the title of "king of the Romans" and had been
practically independent sovereigns in the territory between the Somme and
the Loire, with their capital at Soissons, northeast of Paris.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> Alaric II., king of the Visigoths, 485-507.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> The battle of Soissons in 486, with the defeat and death of Syagrius,
insured for the Franks undisputed possession southward to the Loire, which
was the northern frontier of the Visigothic kingdom.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> The Campus Martius was the "March-field," i.e., the assembling place
of the Frankish army. It was not regularly in any one locality but wherever
the king might call the soldiers together, as he did every spring for purposes
of review. In the eighth century the month of May was substituted for
March as the time for the meeting.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> In the words of Hodgkin (<i>Charles the Great</i>, p. 12), "the well-known
story of the vase of Soissons illustrates at once the German memories of
freedom and the Merovingian mode of establishing a despotism. As a battle
comrade the Frankish warrior protests against Clovis receiving an ounce
beyond his due share of the spoils. As a battle leader Clovis rebukes his
henchman for the dirtiness of his accoutrements, and cleaves his skull to
punish him for his independence."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> The Alemanni were a German people occupying a vast region about the
upper waters of the Rhine and Danube. They had been making repeated
efforts to acquire territory west of the Rhine&mdash;an encroachment which
Clovis resolved not to tolerate.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> The battle was fought near Strassburg, in the upper Rhine valley.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> The ultimate result of the defeat of the Alemanni was that the Frankish
kingdom was enlarged by the annexation of the great region known
in the later Middle Ages as Suabia, comprising modern Alsace, Baden,
Würtemberg, the western part of Bavaria, and the northern part of Switzerland.
The Alemanni as a people disappeared speedily from history, being
absorbed by their more powerful neighbors. Their only monument to-day
is the name by which the French have always known the people of Germany&mdash;<i>Allemands</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> The Loire was the boundary between the dominions of the two kings.
There have been many famous instances in history of two sovereigns coming
together to confer at some point on the common border of the territories
controlled by them, notably the interview of Napoleon and Tsar Alexander I.
on the Niemen River in 1807. The Franks and the Visigoths had been
enemies ever since by Clovis's defeat of Syagrius their dominions had been
brought into contact (486), and the present jovial interview of the two kings
did not long keep them at peace with each other.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> St. Hilary was bishop of Poitiers in the later fourth century. He was a

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_52" id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> This amusing comment of Gregory was due largely to his prejudice in
favor of the Franks and against the heretical Visigoths.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> The Visigothic kingdom in Spain, with its capital at Toledo, endured
until the Saracen conquest of that country in 711 and the years immediately
following, but it did not give evidence of much strength. It stood so long
only because the Pyrenees made a natural boundary against the Franks and
because, after Clovis, for two hundred years the Franks produced no great
conqueror who cared to crowd the Visigoths into still closer quarters.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_54" id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> Clovis, particularly after his conversion to Christianity in 496, was the
hero of Gregory's history and apparently the enthusiastic old bishop did not
lose an opportunity to glorify his career. At any rate it would certainly be
difficult to relate anything more remarkable about him than this legend of
the walls of Angoulême falling down before him at his mere approach.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> This notable campaign had advanced Frankish territory to the Pyrenees,
except for the strip between these mountains and the Rhone, known as
Septimania, which the Visigoths were able to retain by the aid of the Ostrogoths
from Italy. No great number of Franks settled in this broad territory
south of the Loire, and to this day the inhabitants of south France show a
much larger measure of Roman descent than do those of the north. It may
be added that Septimania was conquered by Clovis's son Childebert in 531,
and thus the last bit of old Gaul&mdash;practically modern France&mdash;was brought
under Frankish control.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_56" id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> This was Cloderic, son of Sigibert the Lame, king of a tribe of Franks

or hundred. In early German law the state has small place and the
principle of self-help by the individual is very prominent. To bring a suit
one summons his opponent himself and gets him to appear at court if he can.
Ordinarily the court merely determines the method by which the guilt or
innocence of the accused may be tested. Execution of the sentence rests
again with the plaintiff, or with his family or clan group.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_60" id="Footnote_60" href="#FNanchor_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> "The monetary system of the Salic law was taken from the Romans.
The basis was the gold <i>solidus</i> of Constantine, 1/72 of a pound of gold. The small
coin was the silver <i>denarius</i>, forty of which made a <i>solidus</i>. This system
was adopted as a monetary reform by Clovis, and the statement of the sum
in terms of both coins is probably due to the newness of the system at the time
of the appearance of the law."&mdash;Thatcher and McNeal, <i>Source Book for
Mediæval History</i>, p. 17. The gold <i>solidus</i> was worth somewhere from two
and a half to three dollars, but its purchasing power was perhaps equal to
that of twenty dollars to-day, because gold and silver were then so much
scarcer and more valuable. Such estimates of purchasing power, however,
involve so great uncertainty as to be practically worthless.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_61" id="Footnote_61" href="#FNanchor_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> The Burgundian law (Chap. 41) contained a provision that if a man
made a fire on his own premises and it spread to fences or crops belonging
to another person, and did damage, the man who made the fire should recompense
his neighbor for his loss, provided it could be shown that there was no
wind to drive the fire beyond control. If there was such a wind, no penalty
was to be exacted.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_62" id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> The law of the Lombards had a more elaborate system of fines for wounds
than did the Salic code. For example, knocking out a man's front teeth was
to be paid for at the rate of sixteen <i>solidi</i> per tooth; knocking out back
teeth at the rate of eight <i>solidi</i> per tooth; fracturing an arm, sixteen <i>solidi</i>;
cutting off a second finger, seventeen <i>solidi</i>; cutting off a great toe, six <i>solidi</i>;
cutting off a little toe, two <i>solidi</i>; giving a blow with the fist, three <i>solidi</i>;
with the palm of the hand, six <i>solidi</i>; and striking a person on the head so as
to break bones, twelve <i>solidi</i> per bone. In the latter case the broken bones
were to be counted "on this principle, that one bone shall be found large
enough to make an audible sound when thrown against a shield at twelve
feet distance on the road; the said feet to be measured from the foot of a man
of moderate stature."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_63" id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> The man who had "thrown away his shield" was the coward who had
fled from the field of battle. How the Germans universally regarded such a
person appears in the <i>Germania</i> of Tacitus, Chap. 6 (see <a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>). To impute
this ignominy to a man was a serious matter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_64" id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> This was the so-called "triple wergeld." That is, the lives of men in the
service of the king were rated three times as high as those of ordinary free
persons.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_65" id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> Here is an illustration of the personal character of Germanic law. There
is one law for the Frank and another for the Roman, though both peoples
were now living side by side in Gaul. The price put upon the life of the
Frankish noble who was in the king's service was 600 <i>solidi</i> (<a href="#Sect3">§3</a>), but
that on the life of the Roman noble in the same service was but half that
amount. The same proportion held for the ordinary freemen, as will be
seen by comparing <a href="#Sect1">§§1</a> and <a href="#Sect6">6</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_66" id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> A leet was such a person as we in modern times commonly designate as a

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_67" id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> This has been alleged to be the basis of the misnamed "Salic Law"
by virtue of which no woman, in the days of the French monarchy, was
permitted to inherit the throne. As a matter of fact, however, the exclusion
of women from the French throne was due, not to this or to any other
early Frankish principle, but to later circumstances which called for stronger
monarchs in France than women have ordinarily been expected to be. The
history of the modern "Salic Law" does not go back of the resolution of
the French nobles in 1317 against the general political expediency of female
sovereigns [see <a href="#Page_420">p. 420</a>].</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_68" id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> The wergeld was the value put by the law upon every man's life. Its

meant only that he must not acquire property individually. By gifts of land
and by their own labor the monks became in many cases immensely rich,
but their wealth was required to be held in common. No one man could
rightfully call any part of it his own.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_94" id="Footnote_94" href="#FNanchor_94"><span class="label">[94]</span></a> The converse of this principle was often affirmed by Benedictines in the

months would be: from six o'clock until ten, manual labor; from ten until

second one about half past two, rest and reading; and from the second meal
until evening, labor. Manual labor was principally agricultural.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_98" id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> Gregory's remarks and instructions in the <i>Pastoral Rule</i> were intended
to apply primarily to the local priests&mdash;the humble pastors of whom we hear
little, but upon whose piety and diligence ultimately depended the whole
influence of the Church upon the masses of the people. The general principles
laid down, however, were applicable to all the clergy, of whatever rank.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_99" id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99"><span class="label">[99]</span></a> Gregory, bishop of Nazianzus (in Cappadocia), was a noted churchman
of the fourth century.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_100" id="Footnote_100" href="#FNanchor_100"><span class="label">[100]</span></a> After enumerating quite a number of other contrasted groups in the
foregoing fashion Gregory proceeds in a series of "admonitions" to take up
each pair and tell how persons belonging to it should be dealt with by the
pastor. One of these admonitions is here given as a specimen.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_101" id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> Gregory's attitude toward the "learning of the world," especially the
classical languages and literatures, was that of the typical Christian ascetic.
He had no use for it personally and regarded its influence as positively harmful.
It must be said that there was little such learning in his day, for the old
Latin and Greek culture had now reached a very low stage. Gregory took
the ground that the churches should have learned bishops, but their learning
was to consist exclusively in a knowledge of the Scriptures, the writings of
the Church fathers, and the stories of the martyrs. As a matter of fact not
only were the people generally quite unable to understand the Latin services
of the Church, but great numbers of the clergy themselves stumbled blindly
through the ritual without knowing what they were saying; and this condition
of things prevailed for centuries after Gregory's day. [See Charlemagne's
letter <i>De Litteris Colendis</i>, <a href="#Page_146">p. 146</a>.]</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_106" id="Footnote_106" href="#FNanchor_106"><span class="label">[106]</span></a> This passage, known as the "throne verse," is regarded by Mohammedans

suppose, was designed to express the dignity of these persons and the certainty
of their future glory and happiness."&mdash;Sale, quoted in Wherry, <i>Comprehensive

by the Frankish nobles assembled at Soissons in November, 751. It was
probably in 751 (possibly 752) that Pope Zacharias was consulted. In 754
Pepin was crowned king by Pope Stephen III., successor of Zacharias, who
journeyed to France especially for the purpose.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_117" id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117"><span class="label">[117]</span></a> Einhard, the secretary of Charlemagne [see <a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>], in writing a biography
of his master, described the condition of Merovingian kingship as
follows: "All the resources and power of the kingdom had passed into the
control of the prefects of the palace, who were called the 'mayors of the
palace,' and who exercised the supreme authority. Nothing was left to
the king. He had to content himself with his royal title, his flowing locks,
and long beard. Seated in a chair of state, he was wont to display an appearance
of power by receiving foreign ambassadors on their arrival, and,
on their departure, giving them, as if on his own authority, those answers
which he had been taught or commanded to give. Thus, except for his
empty title, and an uncertain allowance for his sustenance, which the prefect
of the palace used to furnish at his pleasure, there was nothing that the
king could call his own, unless it were the income from a single farm, and that
a very small one, where he made his home, and where such servants as were
needful to wait on him constituted his scanty household. When he went
anywhere he traveled in a wagon drawn by a yoke of oxen, with a rustic
oxherd for charioteer. In this manner he proceeded to the palace, and to the
public assemblies of the people held every year for the dispatch of the business
of the kingdom, and he returned home again in the same sort of state.
The administration of the kingdom, and every matter which had to be undertaken
and carried through, both at home and abroad, was managed by
the mayor of the palace."&mdash;Einhard, <i>Vita Caroli Magni</i>, Chap. 1.</p>

the place was noted throughout Europe for its warm sulphur springs and
for centuries before Charlemagne's day it had been a favorite resort for
health-seekers. It was about the middle of his reign that Charlemagne determined
to have the small palace already existing rebuilt, together with its
accompanying chapel. Marbles and mosaics were obtained at Rome and
Ravenna, and architects and artisans were brought together for the work
from all Christendom. The chapel was completed in 805 and was dedicated
by Pope Leo III. Both palace and chapel were destroyed a short time
before the Emperor's death, probably as the result of an earthquake. The
present town-house of Aix-la-Chapelle has been constructed on the ruins
of this palace. The chapel, rebuilt on the ancient octagonal plan in 983,
contains the tomb of Charlemagne, marked by a stone bearing the inscription
"Carolo Magno." Besides Aachen, Charlemagne had many other residences,
as Compiègne, Worms, Attigny, Mainz, Paderborn, Ratisbon, Heristal, and
Thionville.</p>

in 354. He spent a considerable part of his early life studying in Rome
and other Italian cities. The <i>De Civitate Dei</i> ("City of God"), generally regarded
as his most important work, was completed in 426, its purpose being
to convince the Romans that even though the supposedly eternal city of
Rome had recently been sacked by the barbarian Visigoths, the true "city
of God" was in the hearts of men beyond the reach of desecrating invaders.
When he wrote the book Augustine was bishop of Hippo, an important city
of northern Africa. His death occurred in 430, during the siege of Hippo by
Gaiseric and his horde of Vandals.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_125" id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> The Count of the Palace was one of the coterie of officials by whose aid
Charlemagne managed the affairs of the state. He was primarily an officer
of justice, corresponding in a way to the old Mayor of the Palace, but with
very much less power.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_126" id="Footnote_126" href="#FNanchor_126"><span class="label">[126]</span></a> When Charlemagne captured Pavia, the Lombard capital, in 774, he
found Peter the Pisan teaching in that city. With characteristic zeal for
the advancement of education among his own people he proceeded to transfer
the learned deacon to the Frankish Palace School [see <a href="#Page_144">p. 144</a>].</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_127" id="Footnote_127" href="#FNanchor_127"><span class="label">[127]</span></a> Alcuin was born at York in 735. He took up his residence at Charlemagne's

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_129" id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129"><span class="label">[129]</span></a> These statements of Einhard respecting the lavishness of Charlemagne's
gifts must be taken with some allowance. They were doubtless considerable
for the day, but Charlemagne's revenues were not such as to enable him to
display wealth which in modern times would be regarded as befitting a monarch
of so exalted rank.</p>

<p class="footnote">"Accepting Christianity was to the German very much like changing of

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_138" id="Footnote_138" href="#FNanchor_138"><span class="label">[138]</span></a> The apparent harshness of this whole body of regulations was considerably
diminished in practice by the large discretion left to the priests, as in

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_142" id="Footnote_142" href="#FNanchor_142"><span class="label">[142]</span></a> A prominent characteristic of the early Teutonic religion was that its
ceremonies were invariably conducted out of doors. Tacitus, in the <i>Germania</i>
(Chap. 9), tells us that the Germans had no temples or other buildings
for religious purposes, but worshipped in sacred groves. The "Irmensaule,"
probably a giant tree-trunk, was the central shrine of the Saxon people,
and Charlemagne's destruction of it in 772 was the most serious offense
that could have been committed against them.</p>

and preserved order. There were about three hundred of them in
Charlemagne's empire when at its greatest extent.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_150" id="Footnote_150" href="#FNanchor_150"><span class="label">[150]</span></a> The ordinary estate in this period, whether royal or not, consisted of two
parts. One was the demesne, which the owner kept under his immediate
control; the other was the remaining lands, which were divided among tenants
who paid certain rentals for their use and also performed stated services
on the lord's demesne. Charlemagne instructs his stewards to report
upon both sorts of land.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_161" id="Footnote_161" href="#FNanchor_161"><span class="label">[161]</span></a> The unit of measure was the <i>muid</i>. Charlemagne had a standard measure
(<i>modius publicus</i>) constructed and in a number of his capitularies enjoined
that it be taken as a model by all his subjects. It contained probably a
little less than six pecks. A smaller measure was the <i>setier</i>, containing about
five and two-thirds pints.</p>

manse, were numerous dependent and humbler dwellings, occupied by mechanics,
artisans, and tradesmen, or rather manufacturers and craftsmen,
in great numbers. The dairy, the bakery, the butchery, the brewery, the
flour-mill were there.... The villa was a city in embryo, and in due
course it grew into one, for as it supplied in many respects the wants of the
surrounding country, so it attracted population and became a center of
commerce."&mdash;Jacob I. Mombert, <i>Charles the Great</i> (New York, 1888), pp.

the orchards and kitchen gardens produced the richest and best varieties
of fruit and vegetables. Charles specified by name not less than seventy-four
varieties of herbs which he commanded to be cultivated; all the vegetables
still raised in Central Europe, together with many herbs now found
in botanical gardens only, bloomed on his villas; his orchards yielded a rich
harvest in cherries, apples, pears, prunes, peaches, figs, chestnuts, and
mulberries. The hill-sides were vineyards laden with the finest varieties of
grapes."&mdash;Mombert, <i>Charles the Great</i>, p. 400.</p>

780 she became regent during the minority of her son, Constantine VI., then
only nine years of age. In 790 Constantine succeeded in taking the government
out of her hands; but seven years afterwards she caused him to be
blinded and shut up in a dungeon, where he soon died. The revolting crimes
by which Irene established her supremacy at Constantinople were considered,
even in her day, a disgrace to Christendom.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_171" id="Footnote_171" href="#FNanchor_171"><span class="label">[171]</span></a> This expression has given rise to a view which will be found in some
books that Pope Leo convened a general council of Frankish and Italian
clergy to consider the advisability of giving the imperial title to Charlemagne.
The whole matter is in doubt, but it does not seem likely that there
was any such formal deliberation. Leo certainly ascertained that the leading
lay and ecclesiastical magnates would approve the contemplated step, but
that a definite election in council took place may be pretty confidently denied.
The writer of the Annals of Lauresheim was interested in making the
case of Charlemagne, and therefore of the later emperors, as strong as possible.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_172" id="Footnote_172" href="#FNanchor_172"><span class="label">[172]</span></a> Einhard, Charlemagne's biographer, says that the king at first had such
aversion to the titles of Emperor and Augustus "that he declared he would
not have set foot in the church the day that they were conferred, although
it was a great feast-day, if he could have foreseen the design of the Pope"
(<i>Vita Caroli Magni</i>, Chap. 28). Despite this statement, however, we are not
to regard the coronation as a genuine surprise to anybody concerned. In
all probability there had previously been a more or less definite understanding
between the king and the Pope that in due time the imperial title should
be conferred. It is easy to believe, though, that Charlemagne had had no
idea that the ceremony was to be performed on this particular occasion and
it is likely enough that he had plans of his own as to the proper time and
place for it, plans which Leo rather rudely interfered with, but which the
manifest good-will of everybody constrained the king to allow to be sacrificed.
It may well be that Charlemagne had decided simply to assume the
imperial crown without a papal coronation at all, in order that the whole
question of papal supremacy, which threatened to be a troublesome one,
might be kept in the background.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_173" id="Footnote_173" href="#FNanchor_173"><span class="label">[173]</span></a> The celebration of the Nativity was by far the greatest festival of the
Church. At this season the basilica of St. Peter at Rome was the scene of
gorgeous ceremonials, and to its sumptuous shrine thronged the devout of
all Christendom. Its magnificence on the famous Christmas of 800 was
greater than ever, for only recently Charlemagne had bestowed the most
costly of all his gifts upon it&mdash;the spoils of the Avar wars.</p>

he was but an under-king, since Maine was an integral part of Charlemagne's
dominion. He was anointed by Pope Leo in 800 as heir-apparent to the new
imperial dignity of his father.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_175" id="Footnote_175" href="#FNanchor_175"><span class="label">[175]</span></a> The term "canonical" was applied more particularly to the clergy
attached to a cathedral church, the clergy being known individually as
"canons," collectively as a "chapter." In the present connection, however,
it probably refers to the monks, who, living as they did by "canons" or
rules, were in that sense "canonical clergy."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_176" id="Footnote_176" href="#FNanchor_176"><span class="label">[176]</span></a> The secular clergy were the bishops, priests, deacons, and other church
officers, who lived with the people in the <i>sæculum</i>, or world, as distinguished
from the monks, ascetics, cenobites, anchorites, and others, who dwelt in
monasteries or other places of seclusion.</p>

be found in Magna Charta or the Constitution of the United States. Unfortunately
there was not adequate machinery in the Frankish government
to enforce it, though we may suppose that while the <i>missi</i> continued efficient
(which was not more than a hundred years) considerable progress was made
in this direction.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_186" id="Footnote_186" href="#FNanchor_186"><span class="label">[186]</span></a> The <i>centenarii</i> were minor local officials, subordinate to the counts,

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_187" id="Footnote_187" href="#FNanchor_187"><span class="label">[187]</span></a> In the Frankish kingdom, as commonly among Germanic peoples of
the period, murder not only might be, but was expected to be, atoned for
by a money payment to the slain man's relatives. The payment, known as
the <i>wergeld</i>, would vary according to the rank of the man killed. If it were
properly made, such "composition" was bound to be accepted as complete
reparation for the injury. In this regulation we can discern a distinct advance
over the old system of blood-feud under which a murder almost invariably
led to family and clan wars. Plainly the Franks were becoming
more civilized.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_188" id="Footnote_188" href="#FNanchor_188"><span class="label">[188]</span></a> If a murderer refused to pay the required composition his property was
to be taken possession of by the Emperor's officers and the case must be laid
before the Emperor himself. If the latter chose, he might order the restoration
of the property, but this he was not likely to do.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_189" id="Footnote_189" href="#FNanchor_189"><span class="label">[189]</span></a> Beginning with the reign of Charlemagne there were really two assemblies
each year&mdash;one in the spring, the other in the autumn; but the one in
the spring, the so-called "May-field," was much the more important. All
the nobles and higher clergy attended, and if a campaign was in prospect all
who owed military service would be called upon to bring with them their
portion of the war-host, with specified supplies. Charlemagne proposed all
measures, the higher magnates discussed them with him, and the lower ones
gave a perfunctory sanction to acts already determined upon. The meeting
place was changed from year to year, being rotated irregularly among the
royal residences, as Aix-la-Chapelle, Paderborn, Ingelheim, and Thionville;
occasionally they were held, as in this instance, in places otherwise almost
unknown.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_192" id="Footnote_192" href="#FNanchor_192"><span class="label">[192]</span></a> From earliest Germanic times we catch glimpses of this practice of
requiring gifts from a king's subjects. By Charlemagne's day it had
crystallized into an established custom and was a very important source of
revenue, though other sources had been opened up which were quite unknown
to the German sovereigns of three or four hundred years before. Ordinarily
these gifts, in money, jewels, or provisions, were presented to the sovereign
each year at the May assembly.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_193" id="Footnote_193" href="#FNanchor_193"><span class="label">[193]</span></a> The title "Patricius of Rome" was conferred on Charlemagne by Pope
Hadrian I., in 774. Its bestowal was a token of papal appreciation of the
king's renewal of Pepin's grant of lands to the papacy. In practice the
title had little or no meaning. It was dropped in 800 when Charlemagne
was crowned emperor [see <a href="#Page_130">p. 130</a>].</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_195" id="Footnote_195" href="#FNanchor_195"><span class="label">[195]</span></a> In the Middle Ages it was assumed that churchmen were educated;
few other men had any claim to learning. Charlemagne here says that it
is bad indeed when men who have been put in ecclesiastical positions because
of their supposed education fall into errors which ought to be expected
only from ordinary people.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_197" id="Footnote_197" href="#FNanchor_197"><span class="label">[197]</span></a> After the battle of Fontenay, June 25, 841, Charles and Louis had
separated and Lothair had formed the design of attacking and conquering
first one and then the other. He made an expedition against Charles, but
was unable to accomplish anything before his two enemies again drew together
at Strassburg.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_198" id="Footnote_198" href="#FNanchor_198"><span class="label">[198]</span></a> The name "Francia" was as yet confined to the country lying between

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_199" id="Footnote_199" href="#FNanchor_199"><span class="label">[199]</span></a> This Pepin was a son of Pepin, the brother of Charles, Louis, and Lothair.
Upon the death of the elder Pepin in 838 his part of the empire&mdash;the great
region between the Loire and the Pyrenees, known as Aquitaine&mdash;had been
taken possession of by Charles, without regard for the two surviving sons.
It was natural, therefore, that in the struggle which ensued between Charles
and Louis on the one side and Lothair on the other, young Pepin should have
given such aid as he could to the latter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_202" id="Footnote_202" href="#FNanchor_202"><span class="label">[202]</span></a> The translation of this oath is as follows: "For the love of God, and for
the sake as well of our peoples as of ourselves, I promise that from this day
forth, as God shall grant me wisdom and strength, I will treat this my
brother as one's brother ought to be treated, provided that he shall do the
same by me. And with Lothair I will not willingly enter into any dealings
which may injure this my brother."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_203" id="Footnote_203" href="#FNanchor_203"><span class="label">[203]</span></a> This oath, taken by the followers of the two kings, may be thus translated:
"If Louis [or Charles] shall observe the oath which he has sworn to
his brother Charles [or Louis], and Charles [or Louis], our lord, on his side,
should be untrue to his oath, and we should be unable to hold him to it,
neither we nor any whom we can deter, shall give him any support." The
oath taken by the two armies was the same, with only the names of the
kings interchanged.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_204" id="Footnote_204" href="#FNanchor_204"><span class="label">[204]</span></a> This name in the course of time became simply "Francia," then

long enough for new fortifications to be constructed. Walls were
built at this time to include the quarter of St. Peter's&mdash;a district known to

which connected the right bank of the Seine with the island on which the
city was built. The tower stood on the present site of the Châtelet.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_233" id="Footnote_233" href="#FNanchor_233"><span class="label">[233]</span></a> The Northmen were finally compelled to abandon their efforts against
the tower. They then retired to the bank of the Seine near the abbey of
Saint-Denys and from that place as a center ravaged all the country lying
about Paris. In a short time they renewed the attack upon the city itself.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_234" id="Footnote_234" href="#FNanchor_234"><span class="label">[234]</span></a> Charles the Fat, under whom during the years 885-887 the old empire
of Charlemagne was for the last time united under a single sovereign. When
Odo went to find him in 886 he was at Metz in Germany. German and
Italian affairs interested him more than did those of the Franks.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_235" id="Footnote_235" href="#FNanchor_235"><span class="label">[235]</span></a> Sens was about a hundred miles southeast of Paris. Charles abandoned
the region about Sens to the Northmen to plunder during the winter of
886-887. His very lame excuse for doing this was that the people of the
district did not properly recognize his authority and were deserving of such
punishment.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_236" id="Footnote_236" href="#FNanchor_236"><span class="label">[236]</span></a> The twelve month siege of Paris thus brought to an end had many noteworthy
results. Chief among these was the increased prestige of Odo as a
national leader and of Paris as a national stronghold. Prior to this time
Paris had not been a place of importance, even though Clovis had made it
his capital. In the period of Charlemagne it was distinctly a minor city
and it gained little in prominence under Louis the Pious and Charles the
Bald. The great Carolingian capitals were Laon and Compiègne. The
siege of 885-886, however, made it apparent that Paris occupied a strategic
position, commanding the valley of the Seine, and that the inland city was
one of the true bulwarks of the kingdom. Thereafter the place grew rapidly
in population and prestige, and when Odo became king (in 888) it was made
his capital. As time went on it grew to be the heart of the French kingdom
and came to guide the destinies of France as no other city of modern
times has guided a nation.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_237" id="Footnote_237" href="#FNanchor_237"><span class="label">[237]</span></a> He was deposed in 887, largely because of his utter failure to take any
active measures to defend the Franks against their Danish enemies. From
Paris he went to Germany where he died, January 13, 888, at a small town
on the Danube.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_238" id="Footnote_238" href="#FNanchor_238"><span class="label">[238]</span></a> After the famous siege of Paris in 885-886 the Northmen, or Normans
as they may now be called, continued to ravage France just as they had
done before that event. In 910 one of their greatest chieftains, Rollo, appeared
before Paris and prepared to take the city. In this project he was
unsuccessful, but his warriors caused so much devastation in the surrounding
country that Charles the Simple, who was now king, decided to try negotiations.
A meeting was held at Saint-Clair-sur-Epte where, in the presence
of the Norman warriors and the Frankish magnates, Charles and Rollo
entered into the first treaty looking toward a permanent settlement of Northmen
on Frankish territory. Rollo promised to desist from his attacks upon
Frankland and to become a Christian. Charles agreed to give over to the
Normans a region which they in fact already held, with Rouen as its center,
and extending from the Epte River on the east to the sea on the west. The
arrangement was dictated by good sense and proved a fortunate one for
all parties concerned.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_239" id="Footnote_239" href="#FNanchor_239"><span class="label">[239]</span></a> Robert was Odo's brother. "Duke of the Franks" was a title, at first

in its bearer becoming the first Capetian king [see <a href="#Page_177">p. 177</a>].</p>

Many of the <i>missi</i> were at the same time counts&mdash;a combination of authority
directly opposed to the earlier theory of the administrative system. The
<i>missus</i> had been supposed to supervise the counts and restrain them from
disloyalty to the king and from indulgence in arbitrary or oppressive measures
of local government.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_244" id="Footnote_244" href="#FNanchor_244"><span class="label">[244]</span></a> The viscount (<i>vicecomes</i>) was the count's deputy. By Carloman's time

hereditary.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_245" id="Footnote_245" href="#FNanchor_245"><span class="label">[245]</span></a> The <i>vicarii</i> and <i>centenarii</i> were local assistants of the count in administrative
and judicial affairs. In Merovingian times their precise duties are
not clear, but under the Carolingians the two terms tended to become
synonyms. The <i>centenarius</i>, or hundredman, was charged mainly with
the administration of justice in the smallest local division, i.e., the hundred.
In theory he was elected by the people of the hundred, but in practice he
was usually appointed by the count.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_253" id="Footnote_253" href="#FNanchor_253"><span class="label">[253]</span></a> Charles had been made duke of Lower Lorraine by the German emperor.
This passage in Adalbero's speech looks like something of an appeal to
Frankish pride, or as we would say in these days, to national sentiment.
Still it must be remembered that while a sense of common interest was undoubtedly
beginning to develop among the peoples represented in the assembly
at Senlis, these peoples were still far too diverse to be spoken of
accurately as making up a unified nationality. Adalbero was indulging in
a political harangue and piling up arguments for effect, without much regard
for their real weight.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_254" id="Footnote_254" href="#FNanchor_254"><span class="label">[254]</span></a> Noyon was a church center about fifty miles north of Paris. That the
coronation really occurred at this place has been questioned by some, but
there seems to be small reason for doubting Richer's statement in the matter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_255" id="Footnote_255" href="#FNanchor_255"><span class="label">[255]</span></a> M. Pfister in Lavisse, <i>Histoire de France</i>, Vol. II., p. 412, asserts that the

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_256" id="Footnote_256" href="#FNanchor_256"><span class="label">[256]</span></a> This method of describing the extent of the new king's dominion shows
how far from consolidated the so-called Frankish kingdom really was. The
royal domain proper, that is, the land over which the king had immediate
control, was limited to a long fertile strip extending from the Somme to a
point south of Orléans, including the important towns of Paris, Orléans,
Étampes, Senlis, and Compiègne. Even this was not continuous, but was
cut into here and there by the estates of practically independent feudal
lords. By far the greater portion of modern France (the name in 987 was
only beginning to be applied to the whole country) consisted of great counties
and duchies, owing comparatively little allegiance to the king and usually
rendering even less than they owed. Of these the most important was the
county (later duchy) of Normandy, the county of Bretagne (Brittany),
the county of Flanders, the county of Anjou, the county of Blois, the duchy
of Burgundy, the duchy of Aquitaine, the county of Toulouse, the county of
Gascony, and the county of Barcelona (south of the Pyrenees). The "Goths"
referred to by Richer were the inhabitants of the "march," or border
county, of Gothia along the Mediterranean coast between the lower Rhone
and the Pyrenees (old Septimania).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_261" id="Footnote_261" href="#FNanchor_261"><span class="label">[261]</span></a> This marked a radical departure in methods of fighting the invaders.
On the continent, and hitherto in England, there had been no effort to prevent
the enemy from getting into the country they proposed to plunder.
Alfred's creation of a navy was one of his wisest acts. Although the English
had by this time grown comparatively unaccustomed to seafaring life
they contrived to win their first naval encounter with the enemy.</p>

removed from Exeter to Chippenham. Edington (or Ethandune) was eight
miles from the camp at the latter place. The Danes were first defeated in
an open battle at Edington, and then forced to surrender after a fourteen
days' siege at Chippenham.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_266" id="Footnote_266" href="#FNanchor_266"><span class="label">[266]</span></a> This so-called "Peace of Alfred and Guthrum" in 878 provided only for
the acceptance of Christianity by the Danish leader. It is sometimes
known as the treaty of Chippenham and is not to be confused with the treaty
of Wedmore, of a few weeks later, by which Alfred and Guthrum divided
the English country between them. The text of this second treaty will be
found in Lee's <i>Source-Book of English History</i> (pp. 98-99), though the introductory
statement there given is somewhat misleading. This assignment
of the Danelaw to Guthrum's people may well be compared with the yielding
of Normandy to Rollo by Charles the Simple in 911 [see <a href="#Page_172">p. 172</a>].</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_267" id="Footnote_267" href="#FNanchor_267"><span class="label">[267]</span></a> Ethelwerd was Alfred's fifth living child.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_268" id="Footnote_268" href="#FNanchor_268"><span class="label">[268]</span></a> This was, of course, not a school in the modern sense of the word. All
that is meant is simply that young Ethelwerd, along with sons of nobles
and non-nobles, received instruction from the learned men at the court.
It had been customary before Alfred's day for the young princes and sons
of nobles to receive training at the court, but not in letters.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_271" id="Footnote_271" href="#FNanchor_271"><span class="label">[271]</span></a> Among other labors in behalf of learning, Alfred made a collection of
the ancient epics and lyrics of the Saxon people. Unfortunately, except
in the case of the epic Beowulf, only fragments of these have survived.
Beowulf was, so far as we know, the earliest of the Saxon poems, having
originated before the migration to Britain, though it was probably put in
its present form by a Christian monk of the eighth century.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_272" id="Footnote_272" href="#FNanchor_272"><span class="label">[272]</span></a> Armorica was the name applied in Alfred's time to the region southward

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_273" id="Footnote_273" href="#FNanchor_273"><span class="label">[273]</span></a> There is a good deal of independent evidence that Alfred was peculiarly

and is an instance of the Frankish element in Asser's vocabulary.
Here, as among the Franks, the <i>ministeriales</i> were the officials of second-rate

<i>ministri</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_279" id="Footnote_279" href="#FNanchor_279"><span class="label">[279]</span></a> In Chap. 104 of Asser's biography the <i>capellani</i> are described as supplying
the king with candles, by whose burning he measured time. The word
<i>capellanus</i> is of pure Frankish origin and was originally applied to the clerks
(<i>clerici capellani</i>) who were charged with the custody of the cope (<i>cappa</i>)
of St. Martin, which was kept in the <i>capella</i>. From this the term <i>capella</i>
came to mean a room especially devoted to religious uses, that is, a chapel.
It was used in this sense as early as 829 in Frankland. Whether by <i>capellanus</i>
Asser meant mere clerks, or veritable "chaplains" in the later sense, cannot
be known, though his usage was probably the latter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_280" id="Footnote_280" href="#FNanchor_280"><span class="label">[280]</span></a> Chapter 87 of Asser informs us that Alfred mastered the art of reading

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_281" id="Footnote_281" href="#FNanchor_281"><span class="label">[281]</span></a> Grimbald came from the Flemish monastery of St. Bertin at St. Omer.
He was recommended to Alfred by Fulco, archbishop of Rheims, who had
once been abbot of St. Bertin. We do not know in what year Grimbald
went to England, though there is some evidence that it was not far from
887.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_282" id="Footnote_282" href="#FNanchor_282"><span class="label">[282]</span></a> John the Old Saxon is mentioned by Alfred as his mass-priest. It is
probable that he came from the abbey of Corbei on the upper Weser. Not
much is known about the man, but if he was as learned as Asser says he was,
he must have been a welcome addition to Alfred's group of scholars particularly
as the language which he used was very similar to that of the West
Saxons in England.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_287" id="Footnote_287" href="#FNanchor_287"><span class="label">[287]</span></a> About the year 385 St. Jerome revised the older Latin translation of
the New Testament and translated the Old Testament directly from the
Hebrew. This complete version gradually superseded all others for the
whole Latin-reading Church, being known as the "Vulgate," that is, the
version commonly accepted. It was in the form of the Vulgate that the
Scriptures were known to the Saxons and all other peoples of western Europe.</p>

of the much discussed problem as to whether Jesus was of the same substance
as God and co-eternal with Him. The Arians maintained that while
Jesus was truly the Son of God, He must necessarily have been inferior to
the Father, else there would be two gods. Arianism was formally condemned
by the Council of Nicaea in 325, but it continued to be the prevalent
belief in many parts of the Roman Empire; and when the Germans became
Christians, it was Christianity of the Arian type (except in the case of the
Franks) that they adopted&mdash;because it happened to be this creed that the
missionaries carried to them. The Franks became orthodox Christians,
which in part explains their close relations with the papacy in the earlier
Middle Ages [see <a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>]. Of course Gregory of Tours, who relates the story
of the Arian presbyter, as a Frank, was a hater of Arianism, and therefore we
need not be surprised at the expressions of contempt which he employs in
referring to "the heretic."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_317" id="Footnote_317" href="#FNanchor_317"><span class="label">[317]</span></a> Here is an illustration of the complexity of the feudal system. Count
Thiebault is Jocelyn's <i>fourth</i> lord, and loyalty and service are owed to all
of the four at the same time. Accordingly, Thiebault must be content with
only such allegiance of his new vassal as will not involve a breach of the
contracts which Jocelyn has already entered into with his other lords.
For example, Thiebault could not expect Jocelyn to aid him in war against
the duke of Burgundy, for Jocelyn is pledged to fidelity to that duke. In
general, when a man had only one lord he owed him full and unconditional
allegiance (<i>liege homage</i>), but when he became vassal to other lords he could
promise them allegiance only so far as would not conflict with contracts
already entered into. It was by no means unusual for a man to have
several lords, and it often happened that A was B's vassal for a certain
piece of land while at the same time B was A's vassal for another piece.
Not infrequently the king himself was thus a vassal of one or more of his
own vassals.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_320" id="Footnote_320" href="#FNanchor_320"><span class="label">[320]</span></a> Such a case as this would be most apt to arise when a lord died and a

assails him, and to obey him in all legitimate ways, except in theft, murder,
and in all such things as are not conceded to any one to do and are reckoned

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_328" id="Footnote_328" href="#FNanchor_328"><span class="label">[328]</span></a> It was the feudal system that first gave the eldest son in France a real
superiority over his brothers. This may be seen most clearly in the change
wrought by feudalism whereby the old Frankish custom of allowing all the
sons to inherit their father's property equally was replaced by the mediæval
rule of primogeniture (established by the eleventh century) under which the
younger sons were entirely, or almost entirely, excluded from the inheritance.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_329" id="Footnote_329" href="#FNanchor_329"><span class="label">[329]</span></a> Relief is the term used to designate the payment made to the lord by
the son of the deceased vassal before taking up the inheritance [see <a href="#Page_225">p. 225</a>].
The "custom" says that sometimes the amount paid as an aid to the lord
was equal to half that paid as relief and sometimes it was only a third.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_330" id="Footnote_330" href="#FNanchor_330"><span class="label">[330]</span></a> The number of men brought by a vassal to the royal army depended
on the value of his fief and the character of his feudal contract. Greater
vassals often appeared with hundreds of followers.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_331" id="Footnote_331" href="#FNanchor_331"><span class="label">[331]</span></a> This provision rendered the ordinary feudal army much more inefficient
than an army made up of paid soldiers. Under ordinary circumstances,
when their forty days of service had expired, the feudal troops were free to
go home, even though their doing so might force the king to abandon a
siege or give up a costly campaign only partially completed. By the thirteenth
century it had become customary for the king to accept extra money
payments instead of military service from his vassals. With the revenues
thus obtained, soldiers could be hired who made war their profession and
who were willing to serve indefinitely.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_332" id="Footnote_332" href="#FNanchor_332"><span class="label">[332]</span></a> Every fief-holder was supposed to render some measure of military
service. As neither a minor nor a woman could do this personally, it was
natural that the lord should make up for the deficiency by appropriating
the produce of the estate during the period of wardship.</p>

taking action because of the latter's failure to appear. At last the court
decided that it was useless to delay longer and proceeded to condemn the
guilty noble and send him a statement of what had been done. He was not
only to lose his château of Auvillars but also to reimburse the king for the
expenses which the court had incurred on his account.</p>

famous attack of the Gascons upon Charlemagne's retreating army in 778.
One of the chronicles says simply, "In this battle Roland, count of Brittany,
was slain," and we have absolutely no other historical knowledge of the
man. His career was taken up by the singers of the Middle Ages, however,
and employed to typify all that was brave and daring and romantic. It
was some one of the many "songs of Roland" that William used at Hastings
to stimulate his men.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_341" id="Footnote_341" href="#FNanchor_341"><span class="label">[341]</span></a> In a battle so closely contested this was a dangerous stratagem and its
employment seems to indicate that William despaired of defeating the
English by direct attack. His main object, in which he was altogether successful,
was to entice the English into abandoning their advantageous position
on the hilltop.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_342" id="Footnote_342" href="#FNanchor_342"><span class="label">[342]</span></a> After the Norman victory was practically assured, William sought to
bring the battle to an end by having his archers shoot into the air, that their
arrows might fall upon the group of soldiers, including the king, who were
holding out in defense of the English standard. It was in this way that
Harold was mortally wounded; he died immediately from the blows inflicted
by Norman knights at close hand.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_343" id="Footnote_343" href="#FNanchor_343"><span class="label">[343]</span></a> The victory at Hastings did not at once make William king, but it
revealed to both himself and the English people that the crown was easily
within his grasp. After the battle he advanced past London into the interior
of the country. Opposition melted before him and on Christmas
day, 1066, the Norman duke, having already been regularly elected by the
witan, was crowned at London by the archbishop of York. In the early
years of his reign he succeeded in making his power recognized in the more
turbulent north.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_346" id="Footnote_346" href="#FNanchor_346"><span class="label">[346]</span></a> It seems to be true, as William of Malmesbury says, that the century
preceding the Norman Conquest had been an era of religious as well as
literary decline among the English. After 1066 the native clergy, ignorant
and often grossly immoral, were gradually replaced by Normans, who on
the whole were better men. By 1088 there remained only one bishop of
English birth in the entire kingdom. One should be careful, however, not
to exaggerate the moral differences between the two peoples.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_347" id="Footnote_347" href="#FNanchor_347"><span class="label">[347]</span></a> The story goes that just before entering the battle of Hastings in 1066
William made a vow that if successful he would establish a monastery on
the site where Harold's standard stood. The vow was fulfilled by the
founding of the Abbey of St. Martin, or Battle Abbey, in the years 1070-1076.
The monastery was not ready for consecration until 1094.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_348" id="Footnote_348" href="#FNanchor_348"><span class="label">[348]</span></a> Christchurch. This cathedral monastery had been organized before the
Conqueror's day, but it was much increased in size and in importance by
Lanfranc, William's archbishop of Canterbury; and the great building
which it occupied in the later Middle Ages was constructed at this time.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_352" id="Footnote_352" href="#FNanchor_352"><span class="label">[352]</span></a> A thane (or thegn) was originally a young warrior; then one who became
a noble by serving the king in arms; then the possessor of five hides of land.
A hide was a measure of arable ground varying in extent at the time of
William the Conqueror, but by Henry II.'s reign (1154-1189) fixed at about
100 acres. The thane before the Conquest occupied nearly the same position
socially as the knight after it.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_353" id="Footnote_353" href="#FNanchor_353"><span class="label">[353]</span></a> This assembly of dignitaries, summoned by the king three times a year,
was the so-called Great Council, which in Norman times superseded the
old Saxon witan. Its duties were mainly judicial. It acted also as an advisory
body, but the king was not obliged to consult it or to carry out its
recommendations [see p. <a href="#Footnote_432">307, note 2]</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_354" id="Footnote_354" href="#FNanchor_354"><span class="label">[354]</span></a> The <i>see</i> of a bishop is his ecclesiastical office; the area over which his

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_356" id="Footnote_356" href="#FNanchor_356"><span class="label">[356]</span></a> Odo, though a churchman, was a man of brutal instincts and evil character.
Through his high-handed course, both as a leading ecclesiastical
dignitary in Normandy and as earl of Kent and vicegerent in England, he
gave William no small amount of trouble. The king finally grew tired of
his brother's conduct and had him imprisoned in the town of Rouen where
he was left for four years, or until the end of the reign (1087).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_360" id="Footnote_360" href="#FNanchor_360"><span class="label">[360]</span></a> This statement is doubtful, though it is true that Lanfranc made a beginning
by consecrating a number of bishops in Ireland.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_361" id="Footnote_361" href="#FNanchor_361"><span class="label">[361]</span></a> All of the early Norman kings were greedy for money and apt to bear
heavily upon the people in their efforts to get it. Englishmen were not
accustomed to general taxation and felt the new régime to be a serious
burden. There was consequently much complaint, but, as our historian
says, William was strong enough to be able to ignore it.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_362" id="Footnote_362" href="#FNanchor_362"><span class="label">[362]</span></a> Most of William's harsh measures can be justified on the ground that
they were designed to promote the ultimate welfare of his people. This
is not true, however, of his elaborate forest laws, which undertook to deprive
Englishmen of their accustomed freedom of hunting when and where
they pleased. William's love of the chase amounted to a passion and he
was not satisfied with merely enacting such stringent measures as that the
slayer of a hart or a hind in his forests should be blinded, but also set apart
a great stretch of additional country, the so-called New Forest, as his own
exclusive hunting grounds.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_363" id="Footnote_363" href="#FNanchor_363"><span class="label">[363]</span></a> In other words, it is Duke William's hope that, though not himself
willing to be restricted to the life of a monk, he may secure substantially
an equivalent reward by patronizing men who <i>are</i> thus willing.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_425" id="Footnote_425" href="#FNanchor_425"><span class="label">[425]</span></a> The charter referred to, in which the liberties of the Church were confirmed,
was granted in November, 1214, and renewed in January, 1215.
It was in the nature of a bribe offered the clergy by the king in the hope of
winning their support in his struggle with the barons. The liberty granted
was particularly that of "canonical election," i.e., the privilege of the cathedral
chapters to elect bishops without being dominated in their choice by
the king. Henry I.'s charter (1100) contained a similar provision, but it
had not been observed in practice.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_426" id="Footnote_426" href="#FNanchor_426"><span class="label">[426]</span></a> Tenants <i>in capite</i>, i.e., men holding land directly from the king on condition

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_427" id="Footnote_427" href="#FNanchor_427"><span class="label">[427]</span></a> The object of this chapter is, in general, to prevent the exaction of excessive
reliefs. The provision of Henry I.'s charter that reliefs should be just
and reasonable had become a dead letter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_428" id="Footnote_428" href="#FNanchor_428"><span class="label">[428]</span></a> During the heir's minority the king received the profits of the estate;
in consequence of this the payment of relief by such an heir was to be

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_429" id="Footnote_429" href="#FNanchor_429"><span class="label">[429]</span></a> Scutage (from <i>scutum</i>, shield) was payment made to the king by persons

levied by John had been excessively heavy.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_430" id="Footnote_430" href="#FNanchor_430"><span class="label">[430]</span></a> The General, or Great, Council was a feudal body made up of the king's
tenants-in-chief, both greater and lesser lords. This chapter puts a definite,
even though not very far-reaching, limitation upon the royal power of taxation,
and so looks forward in a way to the later regime of taxation by
Parliament.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_431" id="Footnote_431" href="#FNanchor_431"><span class="label">[431]</span></a> London had helped the barons secure the charter and was rewarded by
being specifically included in its provisions.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_432" id="Footnote_432" href="#FNanchor_432"><span class="label">[432]</span></a> Here we have a definite statement as to the composition of the Great
Council. The distinction between greater and lesser barons is mentioned
as early as the times of Henry I. (1100-1135). In a general way it may be
said that the greater barons (together with the greater clergy) developed into
the House of Lords and the lesser ones, along with the ordinary free-holders,
became the "knights of the shire," who so long made up the backbone
of the Commons. In the thirteenth century comparatively few of the lesser
barons attended the meetings of the Council. Attendance was expensive
and they were not greatly interested in the body's proceedings. It should
be noted that the Great Council was in no sense a legislative assembly.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_433" id="Footnote_433" href="#FNanchor_433"><span class="label">[433]</span></a> It is significant that the provisions of the charter which prohibit feudal
exactions were made by the barons to apply to themselves as well as to the
king.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_434" id="Footnote_434" href="#FNanchor_434"><span class="label">[434]</span></a> This is an important legal enactment whose purpose is to prevent prolonged
imprisonment, without trial, of persons accused of serious crime.
A person accused of murder, for example, could not be set at liberty under
bail, but he could apply for a writ <i>de odio et âtia</i> ("concerning hatred and
malice") which directed the sheriff to make inquest by jury as to whether
the accusation had been brought by reason of hatred and malice. If the jury
decided that the accusation had been so brought, the accused person could
be admitted to bail until the time for his regular trial. This will occur to one
as being very similar to the principle of <i>habeas corpus</i>. John had been
charging heavy fees for these writs <i>de odio et âtia</i>, or "writs of inquisition of
life and limb," as they are called in the charter; henceforth they were to be
issued freely.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_435" id="Footnote_435" href="#FNanchor_435"><span class="label">[435]</span></a> To disseise a person is to dispossess him of his freehold rights.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_436" id="Footnote_436" href="#FNanchor_436"><span class="label">[436]</span></a> Henceforth a person could be outlawed, i.e., declared out of the protection
of the law, only by the regular courts.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_437" id="Footnote_437" href="#FNanchor_437"><span class="label">[437]</span></a> That is, use force upon him, as John had frequently done.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_438" id="Footnote_438" href="#FNanchor_438"><span class="label">[438]</span></a> The term "peers," as here used, means simply equals in rank. The
present clause does not yet imply trial by jury in the modern sense. It
comprises simply a narrow, feudal demand of the nobles to be judged by
other nobles, rather than by lawyers or clerks. Jury trial was increasingly
common in the thirteenth century, but it was not guaranteed in the
Great Charter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_439" id="Footnote_439" href="#FNanchor_439"><span class="label">[439]</span></a> This chapter is commonly regarded as the most important in the charter.
It undertakes to prevent arbitrary imprisonment and to protect private
property by laying down a fundamental principle of government which John
had been constantly violating and which very clearly marked the line of
distinction between a limited and an absolute monarchy.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_440" id="Footnote_440" href="#FNanchor_440"><span class="label">[440]</span></a> The principle is here asserted that justice in the courts should be open to
all, and without the payment of money to get judgment hastened or delayed.
Extortions of this character did not cease in 1215, but they became less exorbitant
and arbitrary.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_441" id="Footnote_441" href="#FNanchor_441"><span class="label">[441]</span></a> The object of this chapter is to encourage commerce by guaranteeing
foreign merchants the same treatment that English merchants received in
foreign countries. The tolls imposed on traders by the cities, however,
were not affected and they continued a serious obstacle for some centuries.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_442" id="Footnote_442" href="#FNanchor_442"><span class="label">[442]</span></a> This chapter provides that, except under the special circumstances of war,
any law-abiding Englishman might go abroad freely, provided only he should
remain loyal to the English crown. The rule thus established continued in
effect until 1382, when it was enacted that such privileges should belong
only to lords, merchants, and soldiers.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_443" id="Footnote_443" href="#FNanchor_443"><span class="label">[443]</span></a> During the struggle with the barons, John had brought in a number of
foreign mercenary soldiers or "stipendiaries." All classes of Englishmen
resented this policy and the barons improved the opportunity offered by
the charter to get a promise from the king to dispense with his continental
mercenaries as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_444" id="Footnote_444" href="#FNanchor_444"><span class="label">[444]</span></a> This chapter provides that the charter's regulation of feudal customs
should apply to the barons just as to the king. The barons' tenants were to
be protected from oppression precisely as were the barons themselves.
These tenants had helped in the winning of the charter and were thus rewarded
for their services.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_445" id="Footnote_445" href="#FNanchor_445"><span class="label">[445]</span></a> The chapter goes on at considerable length to specify the manner in
which, if the king should violate the terms of the charter, the commission of
twenty-five barons should proceed to bring him to account. Even the right
of making war was given them, in case it should become necessary to resort
to such an extreme measure.</p>

but reached Carthage when he was suddenly taken ill and compelled to halt
the expedition. He died there August 25, 1270. Louis was as typical a

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_451" id="Footnote_451" href="#FNanchor_451"><span class="label">[451]</span></a> In the early years of the thirteenth century, an Asiatic chieftain by the
name of Genghis Khan built up a vast empire of Mongol or Tartar peoples,
which for a time stretched all the way from China to eastern Germany.
The rise and westward expansion of this barbarian power spread alarm
throughout Christendom, and with good reason, for it was with great difficulty
that the Tartar sovereigns were prevented from extending their dominion
over Germany and perhaps over all western Europe. After the first
feeling of terror had passed, however, it began to be considered that possibly
the Asiatic conquerors might yet be made to serve the interests of Christendom.
They were not Mohammedans, and Christian leaders saw an opportunity
to turn them against the Saracen master of the coveted Holy Land.
Louis IX.'s reception of an embassy from Ilchikadai, one of the Tartar khans,
or sovereigns, was only one of several incidents which illustrate the efforts
made in this direction. After this episode the Tartars advanced rapidly into
Syria, taking the important cities of Damascus and Aleppo; but a great defeat,
September 3, 1260, by the sultan Kutuz at Ain Talut stemmed the tide
of invasion and compelled the Tartars to retire to their northern dominions.</p>

pilgrims in Palestine. The name was taken from the temple of Solomon, in

they had a prominent part in most of the crusading movements after their

numerous mouths. King Louis found himself on the bank of one of the
streams composing the delta, with the sultan's army drawn up on the other
side to prevent the Christians from crossing. Louis determined to construct
an embankment across the stream, so that his troops might cross and engage
in battle with the enemy. To protect the men engaged in building the embankment,
two towers, called cat castles (because they were in front of
two cats, or covered galleries) were erected. Under cover of these, the work
of constructing a passageway went on, though the Saracens did not cease to
shower missiles upon the laborers.</p>

Enough has been given to show something of the character of the conflicts
between Saracen and crusader. In the end Louis was compelled to withdraw
his shattered army. He then made his way to the Holy Land in the
hope of better success, but the four years he spent there were likewise a
period of disappointment.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_463" id="Footnote_463" href="#FNanchor_463"><span class="label">[463]</span></a> The treaty here referred to is that of Paris, negotiated by Louis IX. and
Henry III. in 1259. By it the English king renounced his claim to Normandy,
Maine, Anjou, Touraine, and Poitou, while Louis IX. ceded to Henry the
Limousin, Périgord, and part of Saintonge, besides the reversion of Agenais
and Quercy. The territories thus abandoned by the French were to be annexed
to the duchy of Guienne, for which Henry III. was to render homage
to the French king, just as had been rendered by the English sovereigns
before the conquests of Philip Augustus. Manifestly Louis IX.'s chief motive
in yielding possession of lands he regarded as properly his was to secure peace
with England and to get the homage of the English king for Guienne. For
upwards of half a century the relations of England and France had been
strained by reason of the refusal of Henry III. to recognize the conquests of
Philip Augustus and to render the accustomed homage. The treaty of Paris
was important because it regulated the relations of France and England to
the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War. It undertook to perpetuate the
old division of French soil between the English and French monarchs&mdash;an
arrangement always fruitful of discord and destined, more than anything else,
to bring on the great struggle of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries between
the two nations [see <a href="#Page_417">p. 417</a> ff.].</p>

communes; they are often found in those of franchise towns.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_471" id="Footnote_471" href="#FNanchor_471"><span class="label">[471]</span></a> The chief magistrate of Laon was a mayor, elected by the citizens. In
judicial matters he was assisted by twelve "jurats."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_474" id="Footnote_474" href="#FNanchor_474"><span class="label">[474]</span></a> This provision was intended to put an end to arbitrary taxation by the
bishop. In the earlier twelfth century serfs were subject to the arbitrary
levy of the taille (tallage) and this indeed constituted one of their most
grievous burdens. Arbitrary tallage was almost invariably abolished by
the town charters.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_475" id="Footnote_475" href="#FNanchor_475"><span class="label">[475]</span></a> By "men of the peace" is meant the citizens of the commune. The term
"commune" is scrupulously avoided in the charter because of its odious
character in the eyes of the bishop. Suits were to be tried at home in the
burgesses' own courts, to save time and expense and insure better justice.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_476" id="Footnote_476" href="#FNanchor_476"><span class="label">[476]</span></a> This trifling payment of sixpence a year was made in recognition of the
lordship of the king, the grantor of the charter. Aside from it, the burgher
had full rights over his land.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_477" id="Footnote_477" href="#FNanchor_477"><span class="label">[477]</span></a> The burghers, who were often engaged in agriculture as well as commerce,
are to be exempt from tolls on commodities bought for their own sustenance
and from the ordinary fees due the lord for each measure of grain harvested.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_478" id="Footnote_478" href="#FNanchor_478"><span class="label">[478]</span></a> The object of this provision is to restrict the amount of military service
due the king. The burghers of small places like Lorris were farmers and
traders who made poor soldiers and who were ordinarily exempted from
service by their lords. The provision for Lorris practically amounted to an
exemption, for such service as was permissible under chapter 3 of the
charter was not worth much.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_479" id="Footnote_479" href="#FNanchor_479"><span class="label">[479]</span></a> The Gâtinais was the region in which Lorris was situated. Étampes,
Milly, and Melun all lay to the north of Lorris, in the direction of Paris. Orleans
lay to the west. The king's object in granting the burghers the right to
carry goods to the towns specified without payment of tolls was to encourage
commercial intercourse.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_480" id="Footnote_480" href="#FNanchor_480"><span class="label">[480]</span></a> This protects the landed property of the burghers against the crown and
crown officials. With two exceptions, fine or imprisonment, not confiscation
of land, is to be the penalty for crime. <i>Hôtes</i> denotes persons receiving land

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_481" id="Footnote_481" href="#FNanchor_481"><span class="label">[481]</span></a> This provision is intended to attract merchants to Lorris by placing them
under the king's protection and assuring them that they would not be molested
on account of old offenses.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_482" id="Footnote_482" href="#FNanchor_482"><span class="label">[482]</span></a> This chapter safeguards the personal property of the burghers, as chapter
5 safeguards their land. Arbitrary imposts are forbidden and any of the
inhabitants who as serfs had been paying arbitrary tallage are relieved of
the burden. The nominal <i>cens</i> (Chap. 1) was to be the only regular payment
due the king.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_483" id="Footnote_483" href="#FNanchor_483"><span class="label">[483]</span></a> An agreement outside of court was allowable in all cases except when
there was a serious breach of the public peace. The provost was the chief
officer of the town. He was appointed the crown and was charged
chiefly with the administration of justice and the collection of revenues.
All suits of the burghers were tried in his court. They had no active part in
their own government, as was generally true of the franchise towns.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_484" id="Footnote_484" href="#FNanchor_484"><span class="label">[484]</span></a> Another part of the charter specifies that only those burghers who owned
horses and carts were expected to render the king even this service.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_485" id="Footnote_485" href="#FNanchor_485"><span class="label">[485]</span></a> This clause, which is very common in the town charters of the twelfth
century (especially in the case of towns on the royal domain) is intended to
attract serfs from other regions and so to build up population. As a
rule the towns were places of refuge from seigniorial oppression and the present
charter undertakes to limit the time within which the lord might recover
his serf who had fled to Lorris to a year and a day&mdash;except in cases
where the serf should refuse to recognize the jurisdiction of the provost's
court in the matter of the lord's claim.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_486" id="Footnote_486" href="#FNanchor_486"><span class="label">[486]</span></a> The sergeants were deputies of the provost, somewhat on the order of

him. He died in 1256, two years after the league was formed.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_493" id="Footnote_493" href="#FNanchor_493"><span class="label">[493]</span></a> These "pfahlburgers" were subjects of ecclesiastical or secular princes
who, in order to escape the burdens of this relation, contrived to get themselves
enrolled as citizens of neighboring cities. While continuing to dwell
in regions subject to the jurisdiction of their lords, they claimed to enjoy
immunity from that jurisdiction, because of their citizenship in those outside
cities. The pfahlburgers were a constant source of friction between the
towns and the territorial princes. The Golden Bull of Emperor Charles IV.
(1356) decreed that pfahlburgers should not enjoy the rights and privileges
of the cities unless they became actual residents of them and discharged their
full obligations as citizens.</p>

of arts and doctor of philosophy. "Master" and "Doctor" were practically
equivalent terms and both signified simply that the bearer, after suitable
examinations, had been recognized as sufficiently proficient to be admitted
to the guild of teachers. The bachelor's degree grew up more obscurely.
It might be taken somewhere on the road to the master's degree, but was
merely an incidental stamp of proficiency up to a certain stage of advancement.
Throughout mediæval times the master's, or doctor's, degree, which
carried the right to become a teacher, was the normal goal and few stopped
short of its attainment.</p>

purposes, members of the clergy (<i>clerici</i>) and thus to be distinguished from
laymen. They were not clergy in the full sense, but were subject to a special
sort of jurisdiction closely akin to that applying to the clergy.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_501" id="Footnote_501" href="#FNanchor_501"><span class="label">[501]</span></a> The law on this point was exceptionally severe. The privilege of establishing
innocence by combat or the ordeal by water was denied, though even
the provost and his subordinates who had played false in the riot of 1200
had been given the opportunity of clearing themselves by such means if
they chose and could do so.</p>

Francis had gone to Spoleto with the intention of joining an expedition about

to abandon his purpose. Returning to Assisi, he redoubled his works of
charity and sought to keep aloof from the people of the town. His old
companions, however, flocked around him, expecting still to profit by his
prodigality, and for a time, being himself uncertain as to the course he would
take, he acceded to their desires.</p>

was an abandoned cottage in the plain of Assisi, an hour's walk from
the town and near the highway between Perugia and Rome. The building
had once served as a leper hospital. Francis and his companions selected
it as a temporary place of abode, probably because of its proximity to the
<i>carceri</i>, or natural grottoes, of Mount Subasio to which the friars resorted
for solitude, and because it was at the same time sufficiently near the Umbrian
towns to permit of frequent trips thither for preaching and charity.</p>

with the secular clergy, i.e., the bishops and priests, the history of the
mendicant orders is filled with the records of strife between the seculars and
friars. This was inevitable, since such friars as had taken priestly orders
were accustomed to hear confessions, preside at masses, preach in parish
churchyards, bury the dead, and collect alms&mdash;all the proper functions of
the parish priests but permitted to the friars by special papal dispensations.

a system of doctrine which sought to combine the principles of Christianity
with others taken over from the Persian and kindred Oriental religions.
The most prominent feature of the resulting creed was the conception of an
absolute dualism running throughout the universe&mdash;light and darkness,
good and evil, soul and body&mdash;which existed from the beginning and should
exist forever. The Manichæan sect spread from Persia into Asia Minor
North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. Though persecuted by Diocletian, and afterwards
by some of the Christian emperors, it had many adherents as late as the

times, notably among the Albigenses in southern France in the twelfth century.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_536" id="Footnote_536" href="#FNanchor_536"><span class="label">[536]</span></a> Annates were payments made to the pope by newly elected or appointed
ecclesiastical officials of the higher sort. They were supposed to comprise
the first year's income from the bishop's or abbot's benefice.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_537" id="Footnote_537" href="#FNanchor_537"><span class="label">[537]</span></a> The <i>décime</i> was an extraordinary royal revenue derived from the payment
by the clergy of a tenth of the annual income from their benefices. Its
prototype was the Saladin tithe, imposed by Philip Augustus (1180-1223)
for the financing of his crusade. In the latter half of the thirteenth century,
and throughout the fourteenth, the <i>décime</i> was called for by the kings with
considerable frequency, often ostensibly for crusading purposes, and it was
generally obtained by a more or less compulsory vote of the clergy, or without
their consent at all.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_538" id="Footnote_538" href="#FNanchor_538"><span class="label">[538]</span></a> Pragmatic, in the general sense, means any sort of decree of public
importance; in its more special usage it denotes an ordinance of the crown
regulating the relations of the national clergy with the papacy. The modern
equivalent is "concordat."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_539" id="Footnote_539" href="#FNanchor_539"><span class="label">[539]</span></a> When the Council of Constance came to an end, in April, 1418, it was
agreed between this body and Pope Martin V. that a similar council should
be convened at Pavia in 1423. When the time arrived, conditions were far
from favorable, but the University of Paris pressed the Pope to observe his
pledge in the matter and the council was duly convened. Very few members
appeared at Pavia, and, the plague soon breaking out there, the meeting
was transferred to Siena. Even there only five German prelates were present,
six French, and not one Spanish. Small though it was, the council entered
upon a course so independent and self-assertive that in the following year
the Pope was glad to take advantage of its paucity of numbers to declare
it dissolved.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_540" id="Footnote_540" href="#FNanchor_540"><span class="label">[540]</span></a> The Dauphiné was a region on the east side of the Rhone which, in 1349,
was purchased of Humbert, Dauphin of Vienne, by Philip VI., and ceded by
the latter to his grandson Charles, the later Charles V. (1364-1380). Charles
assumed the title of "the Dauphin," which became the established designation
of the heir-apparent to the French throne.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_541" id="Footnote_541" href="#FNanchor_541"><span class="label">[541]</span></a> Under the <i>grâce expectative</i> the pope conferred upon a prelate a benefice
which at the time was filled, to be assumed as soon as it should fall vacant.
Benefices of larger importance, such as the offices of bishop and abbot,
were often subject to the <i>réserve</i>; that is, the pope regularly reserved to himself
the right of filling them, sometimes before, sometimes after, the vacancy
occurred. These acts constituted clear assumptions by the popes of power
which under the law of the Church was not theirs, and, though the framers
of the Pragmatic Sanction had motives which were more or less selfish for
combatting the <i>réserve</i> and the <i>grâce expectative</i>, there can be no question
that the abuses aimed at were as real as they were represented to be.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_569" id="Footnote_569" href="#FNanchor_569"><span class="label">[569]</span></a> The French Court of Twelve Peers did not constitute a distinct organization,
but was merely a high rank of baronage. In the earlier Middle Ages,
the number of peers was generally twelve, including the most powerful lay
vassals of the king and certain influential prelates. In later times the number
was frequently increased by the creation of peers by the crown.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_570" id="Footnote_570" href="#FNanchor_570"><span class="label">[570]</span></a> In 1317, after the accession of Philip IV., an assembly of French magnates
(such as that which disposed of the crown in 1328) laid down the
general rule that no woman should succeed to the throne of France. This
rule has come to be known as the Salic Law of France, though it has no
historical connection with the law of the Salian Franks against female inheritance
of property, with which older writers have generally confused it
[see p. <a href="#Footnote_66">67, note 1]</a>. The rule of 1317 was based purely on grounds of political
expediency. It was announced at this particular time because the death of
Louis X. had left France without a male heir to the throne for the first time
since Hugh Capet's day and the barons thought it not best for the realm that
a woman reign over it. Between 1316 and 1328 daughters of kings were
excluded from the succession three times, and though in 1328, when Charles
IV. died, there had been no farther legislation on the subject, the principle of
the misnamed Salic Law had become firmly established in practice. In
1328, however, when the barons selected Philip of Valois to be regent first
and then king, they went a step farther and declared not only that no
woman should be allowed to inherit the throne of France but that the inheritance
could not pass through a woman to her son; in other words, she
could not transmit to her descendants a right which she did not herself
possess. This was intended to cover any future case such as that of Edward
III.'s claim to inherit through his mother Isabella, daughter of Philip IV.
The action of the barons was supported by public opinion in practically all
France&mdash;especially since it appeared that only through this expedient could
the realm be saved from the domination of an alien sovereign.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_571" id="Footnote_571" href="#FNanchor_571"><span class="label">[571]</span></a> Philip of Valois was a son of Charles of Valois, who was a brother of
Philip IV. The line of direct Capetian descent was now replaced by the
branch line of the Valois. The latter occupied the French throne until the
death of Henry III. in 1589.</p>

party in Flanders&mdash;the party which hated French influence, which had
expelled the count of Flanders on account of his services to Philip VI., and
which was the most valuable English ally on the continent. Arteveld was
murdered in 1345 during the civil discord which prevailed in Flanders
throughout the earlier part of the Hundred Years' War.</p>

the county of Artois (the region about the Somme River) and having been

to England and there as an exile had employed every resource to influence
Edward to claim the French throne and to go to war to secure it.</p>

of reinforcements in the shape of a squadron of Flemish vessels. The contest
was not so one-sided or the French defeat so complete as Froissart
represents, yet it was decisive enough, as is indicated by the fact that only
thirty of the French ships survived and 20,000 French and Genoese were
slain or taken prisoners, as against an English loss of about 10,000.</p>

the following day; but, the army falling into hopeless confusion and coming
up unintentionally within sight of the English, he recklessly gave the order
to advance to immediate combat. Perhaps, however, it is only fair to place
the blame upon the system which made the army so unmanageable, rather
than upon the king personally.</p>

important town and its capture was the occasion of much elation among
the French. Treaties were entered into between the duke of Berry on the
one hand and the bishop and citizens of Limoges on the other, whereby the
inhabitants recognized the sovereignty of the French king. It was the news
of this surrender that so angered the Black Prince.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_591" id="Footnote_591" href="#FNanchor_591"><span class="label">[591]</span></a> A force of 3,200 men was led by the Black Prince from the town of Cognac

The three million gold crowns would have a purchasing power of perhaps
forty or forty-five million dollars to-day. On the strength of the treaty
provision John was immediately released from captivity. With curious
disregard of the bad conditions prevailing in France as the result of foreign
and civil war he began preparations for a crusade, which, however, he was
soon forced to abandon. In 1364, attracted by the gayety of English life as
contrasted with the wretchedness and gloom of his impoverished subjects,
he went voluntarily to England, where he died before the festivities in honor
of his coming were completed.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_601" id="Footnote_601" href="#FNanchor_601"><span class="label">[601]</span></a> Dante represents the commentaries composing the <i>Convito</i> as in the
nature of a banquet, the "meats" of which were to be set forth in fourteen
courses, corresponding to the fourteen <i>canzoni</i>, or lyric poems, which were
to be commented upon. As a matter of fact, for some unknown reason, the
"banquet" was broken off at the end of the third course. "At the beginning
of every well-ordered banquet" observes the author in an earlier passage
(Bk. II., Chap. 1) "the servants are wont to take the bread given out for
it, and cleanse it from every speck." Dante has just cleansed his viands from
the faults of egotism and obscurity,&mdash;the "accidental impurities"; he now
proceeds to clear them of a less superficial difficulty, i.e., the fact that in
serving them use is made of the Italian rather than the Latin language.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_602" id="Footnote_602" href="#FNanchor_602"><span class="label">[602]</span></a> The date of the composition of the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i> is unknown,
but there are reasons for assigning the work to the same period in the author's
life as the <i>Convito</i>. Like the <i>Convito</i>, it was left incomplete; four books
were planned, but only the first and a portion of the second were written.
In it an effort was made to establish the dominance of a perfect and imperial
Italian language over all the dialects. The work itself was written in Latin,
probably to command the attention of scholars whom Dante hoped to convert
to the use of the vernacular.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
